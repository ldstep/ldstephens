               Yes, I know, it‚Äôs dangerous to go down this road. But I‚Äôve
               decided not to pander to what everyone else wants, but what I
               want. And what I want is ‚Ä¶ everything in one place.

               Anyway, I&#8217;m glad I got off Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and
               mastodon. You can quit. It&#8217;s difficult at first, and
               inconvenient always, but I can unequivocally state that my life
               is better without them.

            This morning, I got out early for my walk, hoping to beat the start
            of the snowstorm that‚Äôs bearing down on us. Well, I almost got it
            finished before the snow started falling.

            After my fall down the basement stairs the other day, I decided that
            I need to work on improving my balance. Falling is problem when
            you‚Äôre a senior. Lisa encouraged me to start doing yoga. Today was
            my first workout. It made me realize how shitty my balance is!

            It&#8217;s on my mind again&#8211;the constant battle between my
            MacBook and iPad. Why can&#8217;t I just accept that I can use both?
            I can pick whichever one suits me in the moment. There&#8217;s no
            need to choose just one or the other.

            It‚Äôs the first day of Winter, and we woke up to snow this morning.
            About 2 inches. Knowing that it was going to snow overnight, I was
            curious about how Trix (our dog) would like it or if she would. She
            loved it. It was fun to watch her run around, jump up and down, and
            eat the snow.

            &#8220;writing is thinking. In fact there&#8217;s a kind of thinking
            that can only be done by writing.[‚Ä¶] If you&#8217;re thinking
            without writing, you only think you&#8217;re thinking.&#8221;

            A couple of weeks ago we retired our tired Keurig. In its place we
            bought a Ninja Espresso and Coffee Barista System. We‚Äôre enjoying

            Site Analytics: I don't have them on this site, and I don't need
            them because knowing won't make a difference. The fact that I don't
            know them actually makes me feel more comfortable with what I'm
            going to post.

            One of my digital friends is a big fan of EMACS, so I decided to
            watch a beginner‚Äôs guide in order to gain a basic understanding of
            what it is. Looks complicated with a huge learning curve.

            My tech stack plan for 2025 is files over apps and to use

               File over app¬†is a philosophy: if you want to create digital
               artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in
               formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give
               you this freedom.
            </p>

            <p>
               File over app is an appeal to tool makers: accept that all
               software is ephemeral, and give people ownership over their data.

            What a novel idea: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
            proposes stricter regulations on data brokers, requiring them to
            adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This would restrict
            brokers from selling sensitive data, like Social Security numbers,
            unless for legitimate purposes (e.g., credit eligibility). The move
            aims to protect against identity theft and scams, ensuring brokers
            follow consumer protection laws similar to credit bureaus. It may
            also reduce the scale of data sales, forcing some brokers out of
            business. The proposal has broad support despite not addressing data
            breaches directly. Read more:

               Whenever I change blogging platforms or domain names or simply
               post to several places, I feel a twinge of guilt. How will my
               ‚Äúaudience‚Äù feel about the changes? Does it confuse things?[‚Ä¶] I
               don‚Äôt get a lot of traffic, but it‚Äôs also not zero traffic, so I
               feel some responsibility. But why? I am not writing for money or
               influence or popularity. I write to better understand my
               thoughts, and sometimes share the result. I write so that I have
               a record of those things. I write, almost entirely, for me.[‚Ä¶] In
               that light, I shouldn‚Äôt need to worry about whether my RSS feed
               is consistent or if people need to follow me in too many places.
               I don‚Äôt want to be a dick about it, but c‚Äômon, it‚Äôs an
               unimportant personal blog by some nobody on the internet. Let‚Äôs
               not overthink it.

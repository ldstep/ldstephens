            At the time I wrote, “I think I need to try again,” so I did. I
            reinstalled Raycast for the umpteenth time. Yesterday, I returned to
            Alfred. Raycast is undoubtedly a great app. If I were starting fresh
            with a launcher, it would be my top choice. However, having used
            Alfred for so long, I find it difficult to abandon it.

               I’ll start sounding like a broken record but, at this point, I
               don’t care: social media was and still is a mistake. Enough
               people all bunched together in the same space with the ability to
               quickly interact with each other will produce more harm than
               good. And no, decentralising this crap won’t make it better. You
               can lie to yourself and pretend it will, but it won’t. But hey,

            It snowed here again last night and it’s fucking cold. As I write
            this, it’s about time to take Trix out for her afternoon walk and
            it’s only 25° and feels like 13°. We have three more days of this
            Arctic weather. I like the cold weather. Getting all bundled up in
            layers of my winter clothes.

               Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) are
               putting pressure on big tech firms to explain their motives for
               donating to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. In
               letters to Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and

            It’s the first day of Winter, and we woke up to snow this morning.
            About 2 inches. Knowing that it was going to snow overnight, I was
            curious about how Trix (our dog) would like it or if she would. She
            loved it. It was fun to watch her run around, jump up and down, and
            eat the snow.

               File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital

            What a novel idea: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
            proposes stricter regulations on data brokers, requiring them to
            adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This would restrict
            brokers from selling sensitive data, like Social Security numbers,
            unless for legitimate purposes (e.g., credit eligibility). The move
            aims to protect against identity theft and scams, ensuring brokers
            follow consumer protection laws similar to credit bureaus. It may
            also reduce the scale of data sales, forcing some brokers out of

            <p>
               Whenever I change blogging platforms or domain names or simply
               post to several places, I feel a twinge of guilt. How will my
               “audience” feel about the changes? Does it confuse things?[…] I
               don’t get a lot of traffic, but it’s also not zero traffic, so I
               feel some responsibility. But why? I am not writing for money or
               influence or popularity. I write to better understand my
               thoughts, and sometimes share the result. I write so that I have
               a record of those things. I write, almost entirely, for me.[…] In
               that light, I shouldn’t need to worry about whether my RSS feed
               is consistent or if people need to follow me in too many places.
               I don’t want to be a dick about it, but c’mon, it’s an
               unimportant personal blog by some nobody on the internet. Let’s
               not overthink it.

            I gave up on Raycast + Keyboard Maestro and I’m back to Alfred as my
            launcher.

            I already deleted Ulysses and requested a refund. I forgot how
            poorly it handles markdown and code.

            I’m fucking crazy! I just installed <a href="https://ulysses.app/"
               >Ulysses</a
            > and renewed my subscription for a year. Like it or not it’s a
            great writing app.

            Switching launchers on my MacBook from Alfred to Raycast. I’m also
            configuring Raycast to replace some of my Keyboard Maestro macros.

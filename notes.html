            <p>
               Whenever I change blogging platforms or domain names or simply
               post to several places, I feel a twinge of guilt. How will my
               “audience” feel about the changes? Does it confuse things?[…] I
               don’t get a lot of traffic, but it’s also not zero traffic, so I
               feel some responsibility. But why? I am not writing for money or
               influence or popularity. I write to better understand my
               thoughts, and sometimes share the result. I write so that I have
               a record of those things. I write, almost entirely, for me.[…] In
               that light, I shouldn’t need to worry about whether my RSS feed
               is consistent or if people need to follow me in too many places.
               I don’t want to be a dick about it, but c’mon, it’s an
               unimportant personal blog by some nobody on the internet. Let’s
               not overthink it.

            I gave up on Raycast + Keyboard Maestro and I’m back to Alfred as my
            launcher.

            I already deleted Ulysses and requested a refund. I forgot how
            poorly it handles markdown and code.

            I’m fucking crazy! I just installed <a href="https://ulysses.app/"
               >Ulysses</a
            > and renewed my subscription for a year. Like it or not it’s a
            great writing app.

            Switching launchers on my MacBook from Alfred to Raycast. I’m also
            configuring Raycast to replace some of my Keyboard Maestro macros.

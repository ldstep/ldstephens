            Site Analytics: I don't have them on this site, and I don't need
            them because knowing won't make a difference. The fact that I don't
            know them actually makes me feel more comfortable with what I'm
            going to post.

            One of my digital friends is a big fan of EMACS, so I decided to
            watch a beginner’s guide in order to gain a basic understanding of
            what it is. Looks complicated with a huge learning curve.

            My tech stack plan for 2025 is files over apps and to use
            non-subscription apps where possible.

            <p>
               File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital
               artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in
               formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give
               you this freedom.
            </p>

            <p>
               File over app is an appeal to tool makers: accept that all
               software is ephemeral, and give people ownership over their data.

            What a novel idea: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
            proposes stricter regulations on data brokers, requiring them to
            adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This would restrict
            brokers from selling sensitive data, like Social Security numbers,
            unless for legitimate purposes (e.g., credit eligibility). The move
            aims to protect against identity theft and scams, ensuring brokers
            follow consumer protection laws similar to credit bureaus. It may
            also reduce the scale of data sales, forcing some brokers out of
            business. The proposal has broad support despite not addressing data
            breaches directly. Read more:

            <p>
               Whenever I change blogging platforms or domain names or simply
               post to several places, I feel a twinge of guilt. How will my
               “audience” feel about the changes? Does it confuse things?[…] I
               don’t get a lot of traffic, but it’s also not zero traffic, so I
               feel some responsibility. But why? I am not writing for money or
               influence or popularity. I write to better understand my
               thoughts, and sometimes share the result. I write so that I have
               a record of those things. I write, almost entirely, for me.[…] In
               that light, I shouldn’t need to worry about whether my RSS feed
               is consistent or if people need to follow me in too many places.
               I don’t want to be a dick about it, but c’mon, it’s an
               unimportant personal blog by some nobody on the internet. Let’s
               not overthink it.

            I gave up on Raycast + Keyboard Maestro and I’m back to Alfred as my
            launcher.

            I already deleted Ulysses and requested a refund. I forgot how
            poorly it handles markdown and code.

            I’m fucking crazy! I just installed <a href="https://ulysses.app/"
               >Ulysses</a
            > and renewed my subscription for a year. Like it or not it’s a

            Switching launchers on my MacBook from Alfred to Raycast. I’m also
            configuring Raycast to replace some of my Keyboard Maestro macros.

            It snowed here again last night and it’s fucking cold. As I write
            this, it’s about time to take Trix out for her afternoon walk and
            it’s only 25° and feels like 13°. We have three more days of this
            Arctic weather. I like the cold weather. Getting all bundled up in
            layers of my winter clothes.

            I detest posting political content on my blog, but this certainly
            falls under the tech category.

            <p>
               Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) are
               putting pressure on big tech firms to explain their motives for
               donating to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. In
               letters to Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and
               Uber, the lawmakers express concerns about the companies making
               contributions to “avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy
               favor.”

            I’m thinking about where I write blog posts. I usually do it in

            This morning, I got out early for my walk, hoping to beat the start
            of the snowstorm that’s bearing down on us. Well, I almost got it

            It’s the first day of Winter, and we woke up to snow this morning.
            About 2 inches. Knowing that it was going to snow overnight, I was
            curious about how Trix (our dog) would like it or if she would. She
            loved it. It was fun to watch her run around, jump up and down, and
            eat the snow.

            What a novel idea: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
            proposes stricter regulations on data brokers, requiring them to
            adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This would restrict
            brokers from selling sensitive data, like Social Security numbers,
            unless for legitimate purposes (e.g., credit eligibility). The move
            aims to protect against identity theft and scams, ensuring brokers
            follow consumer protection laws similar to credit bureaus. It may
            also reduce the scale of data sales, forcing some brokers out of
            business. The proposal has broad support despite not addressing data
            breaches directly. Read more:

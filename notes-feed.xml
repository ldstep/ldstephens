            <p>January 10, 2025 I quoted <a href="https://mattstein.com/thoughts/default-apps-2023/">Matt Stein</a>. </p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Abandoning Alfred for Raycast was hard, and it even took me two tries because it felt unthinkable, but Raycast is really good and wonderfully connected to other things I use.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>At the time I wrote, “I think I need to try again,” so I did. I reinstalled Raycast for the umpteenth time. Yesterday, I returned to Alfred. Raycast is undoubtedly a great app. If I were starting fresh with a launcher, it would be my top choice. However, having used Alfred for so long, I find it difficult to abandon it.</p>

            <p>GoodLinks: "GoodLinks 2.3 is out now! This update adds "Recently Deleted" list. Links are available for 30 days. After that time, links will be permanently deleted. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve deleted something after reading it, only to later want to refer back to it and have to waste time searching for it again. Fortunately, it will now be stored in the Recently Deleted folder for 30 days.</p>

        <p>Hi, I’m ldstephens. Welcome to my blog! I’m a techie who loves talking about tech. ldstephens has been going since 2016, covering everything from Apple gadgets, apps, tips, and tricks to general tech news. (You can find everything that I wrote between 2016 and 2023 mothballed <a href="https://ldstephens.net/blog-archive/">here</a>).</p>

		<p>In addition to my tech-related content, I also blog about various other topics that I find interesting, such as news and culture. I’m always looking for new and interesting ways to share my thoughts and experiences.</p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>

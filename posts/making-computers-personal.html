            Using apps such as Drafts, Raycast, Keyboard Maestro, PopClip, and
            Hazel, I have customized my Mac with a significant amount of
            automation. As a result, using another person’s Mac feels unfamiliar
            to me. That’s how feel when my wife asks me to help her out with
            something on her Mac.

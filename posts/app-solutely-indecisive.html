            I find myself constantly switching between different apps, services,
            and devices, much like I'd change my underwear. Why can't I just
            settle on what works best for me and stop this endless cycle of app
            flip-flopping? What the fuck is up with me?
         </p>

         <p>
            My problem is that I'm easily influenced by what other tech
            enthusiasts are using. If they're using app X, I feel like I should
            be using app X too. This tendency is particularly evident in the
            blogging world, where it's become a trend to publish blog posts
            listing the default apps used for various tasks.

            Recently,
            <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me/"
               >I browsed through some of these blog posts</a
            >, evaluating how many people were using Reeder versus NetNewWire
            and whether they were using Feedbin or iCloud for their backend.
            This sparked my interest because
            <a

               >my Feedbin subscription is up for renewal</a
            >
            in a few weeks, and I'm considering eliminating it.
         </p>

         <p>
            Another area that piqued my curiosity was the notes and writing apps
            that others were using. I was particularly interested in how many
            people were using Drafts, an app I personally love for all my
            text-based needs. However, noticing that Drafts wasn't as popular as
            I'd expected made me question whether I should switch to Ulysses or
            iA Writer, which were mentioned more frequently.
         </p>

         <p>
            I'm sure you get the gist of my problem. My goal is to finally
            settle on the apps that genuinely work for me and break free from
            this endless cycle of app flip-flopping. How about you?

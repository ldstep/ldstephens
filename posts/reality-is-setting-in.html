         <p>
            Going through my RSS feed this afternoon, I came across a 9to5 Mac
            post that said I could get an M3 MacBook Air with 16 GB of RAM and
            256 storage for \$899 at Amazon or Best Buy. That got my attention,
            and I thought I should take advantage of that price. It’s \$400 off.
         </p>

         <p>
            Sitting here and thinking about it now, reality is setting in. That
            new M3 Air won’t do anything that my M1 Air isn’t already doing for
            me.

            I bet you've been on a phone call you wanted to end and couldn't
            come up with a way to do it. A dropped call is the perfect solution!
         </p>

         <p>
            You can simulate a dropped call on an iPhone by turning on Airplane
            Mode. This can be done through Control Center by swiping down from
            the top right corner of the display and tapping on the Airplane icon
            or through the Settings app by toggling the Airplane Mode switch.
            The Airplane Mode disconnects all cellular and network connections
            on your iPhone and results in an active call being dropped even
            though the reason for the drop was initiated by the user and not by
            poor service or network issues.

            Let me tell you something: I love my iPad Pro. It's a fantastic tool
            for reading, research, and even writing. But here's the deal: the
            lack of a decent clipboard manager makes me want to tear my fucking
            hair out.
         </p>

         <p>
            Every. Single. Day. I'm copying and pasting things. Snippets from
            articles, research notes, half-written sentences. And yet, on the
            iPad Pro, it's an exercise in frustration. The measly one-item
            clipboard is a joke.
         </p>

         <p>
            Sure, there are those workaround tactics
            <a

               >that I wrote about</a
            >
            the other day, but let's call a spade a spade â€“ they're just that,
            work-arounds. I get pissed when I start a task that demands copying
            and pasting; it's at that moment I reluctantly shift to my Mac. A
            move that shouldn't be necessary yet becomes an unavoidable ritual
            due to the iPad Pro's clipboard limitations.
         </p>

         <p>
            Why should I be compelled to switch devices mid-stream just to
            manage a fundamental function like copy-pasting? This iPad Pro issue
            really bothers me, even though I enjoy using it. It deserves better,
            and it's high time Apple addressed this glaring shortcoming. Fix it
            please, Apple.

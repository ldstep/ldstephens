         <h2>7 Reasons why I register domains with Hover</h2>

         <p>
            After many years of using GoDaddy, I registered my first domain with
            <a href="https://hover.com/uVPu2FkM">Hover</a> in 2016. By the way,
            I'm pretty sure I heard about Hover on an MPU podcast years ago.
            Anyway, having my domains with Hover has been an unbelievably good
            experience. Here's why.
         </p>

         <ol>
            <li>A simple domain management experience.</li>
            <li>Hundreds of domain extensions to choose from.</li>
            <li>Free Whois Privacy to protect my contact information.</li>
            <li>Powerful domain management tools.</li>
            <li>No upselling.</li>
            <li>
               No spam. Hover only sends me a reminder when my domains are about
               to expire. That's it. No unwanted emails.
            </li>
            <li>Phone, chat, and email support.</li>
         </ol>

         <p>
            So if you are looking for a better domain registration service to
            register your domains, don't hesitate. Register your next domain
            with Hover. And please use my
            <a href="https://hover.com/uVPu2FkM">link</a> so I get credit. This
            helps support this blog and costs you nothing extra.
         </p>

         <p>
            Full disclosure: I'd still recommend them even if they didn't have
            an affiliate program.

            Did you know that
            <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14726057">Fastmail</a> has
            folders that will auto-purge emails? This feature allows you to
            automatically delete messages from a folder after a certain amount
            of time. Iâ€™ve found that this is a great way to manage notification
            emails that I want to keep but not forever.
         </p>

         <p>
            To set up a folder with auto-purge, just follow these simple steps:
         </p>

         <ol>
            <li>Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> page in Fastmail.</li>
            <li>Click on the <strong>Folders</strong> tab.</li>
            <li>Find the folder that you want to set up auto-purge for.</li>
            <li>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
            <li>
               Scroll down to the <strong>Automated Actions</strong> section.
            </li>
            <li>
               Check the box next to
               <strong>Auto-purge this folder on a selected date</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Select the number of days after which you want the messages to be
               deleted.
            </li>
            <li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
         </ol>

         <p>
            That's it! Once you've set up a folder with auto-purge, any messages
            that are older than the specified number of days will be
            automatically deleted.
         </p>

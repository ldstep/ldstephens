            <p>
               I have a long-standing position on politics: don’t make your
               politics my problem, and I won’t let mine become yours.
            </p>

            <p>
               I am not saying that I don’t have strong political feelings
               because I do, but I am saying that I’m not interested in
               discussing that topic with anyone I wouldn’t hug. This seems to
               be the healthiest approach.
            </p>

         <p>
            Whether I agree with or disagree with your politics, I don’t want to
            read about them. If you must write about them, I’ll remove you from
            my RSS feed. I agree with Sam. We all have political views, and as
            divided as we are over those views, the healthiest approach is to
            not fucking discuss them.

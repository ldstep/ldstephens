            Occasionally, there are times when you may want to convert an image
            to a PDF. There are several reasons why you might want to do this.
            Firstly, PDFs are easily shareable; you can send them via email,
            text message, or upload them online. Secondly, PDFs are more secure
            than image files, which can be easily edited or altered. Converting
            your photos to PDFs ensures that they remain unchanged. Finally,
            PDFs take up less space on your device than image files, which can
            help you free up storage space.

            Converting your photos to PDF is a simple and effective way to
            organize and share your images. PDFs are more secure than image
            files, take up less space on your device, and retain their
            formatting when opened on any device. With the steps outlined above,
            you can easily convert your photos to PDF on your iPhone or iPad.

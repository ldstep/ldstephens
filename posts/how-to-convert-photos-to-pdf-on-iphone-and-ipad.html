            Occasionally, there are times when you may want to convert an image
            to a PDF. There are several reasons why you might want to do this.
            Firstly, PDFs are easily shareable; you can send them via email,
            text message, or upload them online. Secondly, PDFs are more secure
            than image files, which can be easily edited or altered. Converting
            your photos to PDFs ensures that they remain unchanged. Finally,
            PDFs take up less space on your device than image files, which can
            help you free up storage space.

         <h4>Steps to Convert Photos to PDF on iPhone and iPad</h4>

         <ol>
            <li>
               Launch the Photos app on your iPhone and tap the Select button in
               the top-right corner.
            </li>
            <li>
               Now, tap to select the photos you want to convert to PDF and tap
               the Share button in the bottom-right corner.
            </li>
            <li>
               Swipe up the Share Sheet to reveal all the options and tap the
               Print button.
            </li>
            <li>
               You will see the print preview of all the selected photos. Tap
               the Share button in the top-right corner and choose the Save to
               Files option.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, tap the Save button to save the PDF file.</li>
            <li>
               To open the PDF file, launch the Files app and navigate to the
               location you have saved the file. By default, it will be the
               Downloads folder.
            </li>
            <li>
               As you can see, we have created the PDF from selected photos.

         </ol>

         <p>
            Converting your photos to PDF is a simple and effective way to
            organize and share your images. PDFs are more secure than image
            files, take up less space on your device, and retain their
            formatting when opened on any device. With the steps outlined above,
            you can easily convert your photos to PDF on your iPhone or iPad.

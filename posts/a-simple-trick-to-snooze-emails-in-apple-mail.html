            Do you ever find yourself wanting to snooze emails in Apple Mail? If
            you primarily use Apple Mail, I have a trick up my sleeve that you
            might find helpful:
            <strong>snoozing emails using the Reminders app</strong>.
         </p>

         <p>
            Now, Apple Mail itself doesn't have a built-in snooze feature, but
            by leveraging Reminders, you can achieve a similar effect. Here's
            how:
         </p>

         <ol>
            <li><p>Open the email you want to snooze.</p></li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Select some text in the email, like the subject. This helps
                  identify the email later in your Reminders.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Right-click the selected text and choose Share.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the sharing menu, select Reminders.</p></li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  A new reminder is created with the selected text and a link
                  back to the original email in your Mail app. Now, you can set
                  a specific date and time to be reminded about this email.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ol>

         <p>
            Tip: I recommend creating a dedicated Reminders list titled “Snoozed
            Emails” to keep these reminders organized and easily accessible.
         </p>

         <p>
            This way, you can snooze an email, knowing that the Reminders app
            will nudge you at the designated date and time.

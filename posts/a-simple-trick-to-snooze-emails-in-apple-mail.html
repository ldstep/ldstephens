        <p>Do you ever find yourself wanting to snooze emails in Apple Mail? If you primarily use Apple Mail, I have a trick up my sleeve that you might find helpful: <strong>snoozing emails using the Reminders app</strong>.</p>

        <p>Now, Apple Mail itself doesn't have a built-in snooze feature, but by leveraging Reminders, you can achieve a similar effect. Here's how:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Open the email you want to snooze.</p></li>
        <li><p>Select some text in the email, like the subject. This helps identify the email later in your Reminders.</p></li>
        <li><p>Right-click the selected text and choose Share.</p></li>
        <li><p>In the sharing menu, select Reminders.</p></li>
        <li><p>A new reminder is created with the selected text and a link back to the original email in your Mail app. Now, you can set a specific date and time to be reminded about this email.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Tip: I recommend creating a dedicated Reminders list titled “Snoozed Emails” to keep these reminders organized and easily accessible.</p>
        
        <p>This way, you can snooze an email, knowing that the Reminders app will nudge you at the designated date and time.</p>

            Hey friends, <a href="https://goodlinks.app">Goodlinks</a> is my
            all-time favorite read-later and bookmarking app. With the release
            of version 2.0, overnight highlighting is finally here! GoodLinks
            serves as both a bookmark manager and a read-it-later app. It’s a
            one-time \$9.99 purchase in the App Store, requiring no account on
            any web server. Your links and downloaded articles live on your
            devices, with the option to sync via iCloud. It’s a universal app,
            available on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Highlighting is a premium
            feature for only \$4.99 per year.
         </p>

            reasonable price give it a try.

         <p><strong>2.0 Release Notes:</strong></p>

         <blockquote>
            <p>
               You can now highlight important information within articles and
               add notes to them, making it easier for you to remember key
               passages. Additionally, you can export highlights in Markdown
               format for seamless integration with other apps. This update also
               adds support for new Shortcuts actions, allowing you to retrieve,
               edit, delete, and open highlights. And to further optimize your
               workflow, the Highlight widget has been introduced, ensuring
               quick access to your annotated content right from your home
               screen.
            </p>

            <p>

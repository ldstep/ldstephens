        <p>Hey friends, <a href="https://goodlinks.app">Goodlinks</a> is my all-time favorite read-later and bookmarking app. With the release of version 2.0, overnight highlighting is finally here! GoodLinks serves as both a bookmark manager and a read-it-later app. It’s a one-time \$9.99 purchase in the App Store, requiring no account on any web server. Your links and downloaded articles live on your devices, with the option to sync via iCloud. It’s a universal app, available on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Highlighting is a premium feature for only \$4.99 per year.</p>

        <p>If you’re looking for a great read-later and bookmarking app at a reasonable price give it a try. </p>

        <p><strong>2.0 Release Notes:</strong> </p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>You can now highlight important information within articles and add notes to them, making it easier for you to remember key passages. Additionally, you can export highlights in Markdown format for seamless integration with other apps. This update also adds support for new Shortcuts actions, allowing you to retrieve, edit, delete, and open highlights. And to further optimize your workflow, the Highlight widget has been introduced, ensuring quick access to your annotated content right from your home screen.</p>

        <p>GoodLinks Premium: Highlighting is the first premium feature of GoodLinks Premium, an optional subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year after your date of purchase. If you purchased the app within the last 12 months, you will get Highlighting for free, with no additional purchase required. For users who purchased the app earlier, it will require you to subscribe to unlock. Once unlocked, these features are yours to keep forever, even if you choose to unsubscribe right after subscribing. GoodLinks Premium brings a more sustainable business model to the app, allowing us to invest in more features and ensuring the app's long-term development.</p>

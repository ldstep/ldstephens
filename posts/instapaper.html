         <p>
            Once upon a time,
            <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> was my go-to
            read-it-later app. Over the years it’s had a long and convoluted
            life some good and some not so good. During one of those not-so-good
            times, I switched to <a href="https://goodlinks.app">Goodlinks</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            Lately, Instapaper has been getting a lot of attention so every time
            the app gets updated I install it to test it out. Today I got an
            email from the developer announcing version 9.1 so I installed it
            and I’m using it in place for Goodlinks for the time being. One of
            the things that I like about Instapaper is the way it integrates
            with
            <a href="https://www.reederapp.com/classic/">Reeder Classic</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            I’m not sure if I’ll continue using Instapaper, but if I do, the
            free version is sufficient for my needs.

         <p>
            This morning as I sat down at my iMac to start my day, the first
            thing I did was launch
            <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>,
            <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>,
            <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a>, and Safari. I do this
            using keyboard shortcuts. While doing this, it occurred to me that
            this isn’t the way most people launch apps on their Mac, so I want
            to share how I do this with you.
         </p>

         <p>
            Using keyboard shortcuts lets you perform actions faster and more
            efficiently, cutting down on mouse and trackpad usage. So, how do I
            create these keyboard shortcuts? I do it using
            <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a
            >. Within Keyboard Maestro I have a Group called Launch Apps. This
            is where all my launcher macros live. Here’s the launcher macro,
            which you can duplicate:
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MM6uVOx.png" alt="" />
            Repeat this for all the apps that you would like to launch using a
            keyboard shortcut. If you create the macro the way I have, the
            hotkey will show and hide the app.
         </p>

         <p>
            Tomorrow I’ll walk you through how to launch apps with keyboard
            shortcuts using <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>.

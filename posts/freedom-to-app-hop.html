               I’m going to use whatever apps I feel like using on any given
               day. That’s just the way I am. The trick is to stop thinking that
               I need to choose something <em>for good</em>. I can just pick up
               whichever tool gives me the best vibes right now and stop
               worrying about which is “best”.

            I'm like this when it comes to writing apps. I feel like I need to
            pick an app and stick with it. But the truth is, some days I like to
            write in Drafts other days I like to write in MarkEdit as I’m doing
            now. And then on another day, I’ll use iA Writer.

            I also do this with my RSS aggregator apps. I bounce around between
            Reeder, NetNewsWire, and Unread.

         <p>Then there’s the Mac or iPad conundrum.</p>

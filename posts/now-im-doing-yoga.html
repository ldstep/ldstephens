            Hey friends, at 80, I like to think I’m pretty fit for my age. I’m 6
            feet tall and weigh 165 pounds. Trix, our dog, and I walk 2 miles
            every single day, no exceptions. We’ve got a 10-acre property that
            keeps me plenty busy. In the winter, we heat the house with firewood
            I cut and split myself. I have a 35-ton log splitter that makes the
            job easier. Staying active is just who I am.

            A few weeks ago I took a tumble down the basement stairs. Luckily I
            didn’t get hurt badly. A sore hip, sore back, and a gash on the palm
            of my left hand from attempting to catch myself. Oh yeah, my Apple
            Watch didn’t detect my fall. What the fuck?
         </p>

            This isn’t my only fall over the last few years. As you age, poor
            balance becomes a concern, as the risk of falls increases. So with
            this last fall, Lisa insisted that I start doing Yoga that focuses
            on improving balance and core strength. So to get her off my back I
            agreed to start doing Yoga three times a week. Week one I realized
            how shitty my balance is. Week two I’m starting to see some slight
            improvement. Now on top of everything else that I do, I’m doing yoga
            three times a week.

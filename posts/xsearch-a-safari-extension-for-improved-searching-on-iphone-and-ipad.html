         <p>
            Every day, while using my iPad, I often stumble upon new apps that
            help me be more productive. Take, for example, my Mac setup â€“
            I&#8217;ve got Alfred triggers that speed up searches on certain
            websites. These websites usually have a predictable URL structure
            for search results, making automation pretty easy. With Alfred, you
            can set up the URL, add your search terms, and boom, you&#8217;re
            searching away. You can kinda do something similar with Shortcuts on
            iOS and iPadOS, but it&#8217;s not as smooth because it
            doesn&#8217;t work directly from the address bar.
         </p>

         <p>
            With
            <a
               href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xsearch-for-safari/id1579902068"
               >xSearch</a
            >, you can set up the same sort of thing inside the address bar.
            xSearch is an iOS and iPadOS Safari extension that allows you to
            seamlessly switch between multiple search engines with ease, and
            even search directly from Spotlight. This can make your browsing
            experience more efficient and.
         </p>

         <p>Here are some of the features of xSearch:</p>

         <ul>
            <li>
               Switch between multiple search engines with ease: You can add as
               many search engines as you want to xSearch, and then switch
               between them.
            </li>
            <li>
               Search directly from Spotlight: You can also use xSearch to
               search directly from Spotlight, without having to open Safari
               first.
            </li>
            <li>
               Custom search prefixes: You can create custom search prefixes for
               each search engine. For example, you could set up a prefix of
               &#8220;g&#8221; to search Google, and a prefix of
               &#8220;ddg&#8221; to search DuckDuckGo.
            </li>
            <li>
               Shortcuts: You can also create shortcuts for frequently searched
               terms. For example, you could create a shortcut for
               &#8220;weather&#8221; that would search for the weather in your
               current location.
            </li>
         </ul>

         <p>xSearch is a paid app on the App Store, priced at only $1.99.</p>

         <p>I hope this app boosts your iPhone and iPad productivity!</p>

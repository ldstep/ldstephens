         <p>
            About a year ago, I made a significant decision to move away from
            using <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> as my primary
            information repository. At the time, I transferred all my notes,
            research, long-term thinking, and journaling from Drafts to plain
            text files. It felt like a big shift. However, just this week, I
            made another change. I moved all my text-processing tasks back into
            Drafts.
         </p>

         <p>
            While Drafts is now my go-to for notes, research, long-term
            thinking, and journaling, I still prefer to do my writing in
            <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Ulysses</a> versus Drafts.
         </p>

         <p>
            As a side note, if you're considering using Drafts as an information
            repository, remember that it strictly supports plain text only. Rich
            content like images or videos is a no-go. To fill this gap, I rely
            on Apple's Notes app.
         </p>

         <p>
            One of the main reasons for my shift back to Drafts is my
            dissatisfaction with managing individual files in Finder, especially
            on the Files app for my iPhone and iPad. Drafts is a more powerful
            and versatile solution. Its database structure provides several
            advantages, including better organization, robust search
            capabilities, version control, collaboration features, automation,
            easy export options, and seamless syncing.
         </p>

         <p>
            The debate over whether to use individual files or a database for
            storing information is ongoing. There's no definitive answer; it
            simply boils down to personal preference. In my case, the
            flexibility and features of Drafts won me over once again.

            Today marks the ninth anniversary of our dog Nemo’s passing. Nemo
            was an amazing dog who enriched our lives in so many ways. When we
            first adopted him, we were told that he had been at the shelter for
            about a year and had been adopted a few times and returned. It was
            clear that Nemo was meant to be with us, and I’m so grateful that I
            got to be his human.
         </p>

         <p>
            In October 2013, I noticed that Nemo was having trouble with his
            balance when he lifted his leg to pee. He eventually lost his
            balance and would fall over, so I took him to the vet. He was
            diagnosed with degenerative myelopathy, a terrible disease that
            slowly degenerates the spinal cord. Nemo’s condition worsened over
            time, and it was heartbreaking to see him lose his muscle strength,
            stumble, and eventually become incontinent.
         </p>

         <p>
            In April 2014, we made the difficult decision to let Nemo go. It was
            a painful decision, but we knew that it was the right thing to do
            for our beloved dog. With vet assistance, Nemo passed away on
            Saturday, April 19th, 2014. I still fucking miss him every day, but
            we take comfort in knowing that he is in a better place now, running
            and playing with Tonka and Lola.

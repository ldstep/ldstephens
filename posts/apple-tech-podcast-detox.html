         <p>
            As I’ve gotten older, I've been simplifying my life in various ways.
            But one area still needs work: my technology addiction.
         </p>

         <p>
            Over the years, I’ve built the perfect tech stack apps, devices, and
            automations all setup just like I want them. I’m no longer
            interested in tinkering with new apps; it’s a waste of time and
            money. And I’m definitely not interested in being told I need a Mac
            to get real work done when my iPad works just fine. Frankly, that’s
            bullshit! That said I prefer my MacBook.
         </p>

         <p>
            These external pressures come from the Apple tech podcasts I’ve been
            listening to for years. But I’m done being influenced. So, I’m
            cutting the influencers:
         </p>

         <ul>
            <li>Mac Power Users</li>
            <li>Automators</li>
            <li>Upgrade</li>
            <li>Connected</li>
            <li>iPad Pros</li>
            <li>ATP</li>
         </ul>
      </div>

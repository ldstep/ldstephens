         <p>
            Here we are again - another year has flown by! They seem to go by
            faster and faster, and 2024 was no exception. It&#8217;s hard to
            believe we&#8217;re already in 2025.
         </p>

         <p>
            While I&#8217;m not one to dwell too much on the past, I will say
            that 2024 was a good year for Lisa and me. Looking ahead, my hope
            for 2025 is to continue living a healthy lifestyle and making the
            most of each day. I&#8217;ve got a couple of significant milestones
            coming up this year, which I&#8217;ll likely share more about when
            the time comes.
         </p>

         <p>Happy New Year, and thank you for being a reader!</p>

         <p>
            I prefer organizing my day sorted by lists in Apple's Reminders.
            While the app provides alternatives like sorting by due date,
            creation date, priority, and title, the list-based sorting feature
            is noticeably missing. In this post, I'll share the workaround I've
            crafted to view my Today tasks sorted by lists until Apple
            (hopefully) introduces this feature in a future update.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Creating a Group:</strong></p>

         <p>
            To get started, I create a new Group in Reminders and give it the
            name “Today's ToDo List” or any title that suits my preference.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Smart Lists for Each List:</strong></p>

         <p>
            Within the “Today's ToDo List” group, I set up a smart list for each
            of my existing lists. This involves creating a new smart list and
            filtering tasks based on the specific list criteria.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Accessing Today's ToDo List:</strong></p>

         <p>
            When I want to see my tasks sorted by lists, I simply click or tap
            on the “Today's ToDo List” group. This action opens up a
            comprehensive view of all my tasks for the day, neatly organized by
            lists.
         </p>

         <p>
            Now, managing my daily tasks is organized in a way that I can
            quickly identify and prioritize tasks based on their respective
            lists. Give this method a try to streamline your daily task
            management in Reminders.

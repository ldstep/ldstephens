            Home Depot is gradually rolling out Apple Pay support, according to
            reports from
            <a

            readers and social media. While the company hasn’t officially
            commented, the rollout started in select stores over the summer and
            has recently expanded.

            I haven’t been to Home Depot in a couple of weeks, so I’m not sure
            if our local store has it yet, but I’ll definitely check. Apple Pay
            is my go-to, and we buy a ton of shit from Home Depot. It’s always
            frustrating when I can’t use Apple Pay at checkout.

            I recently read
            <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/digital-responsibilities"
               >Manu's blog post</a
            >
            about a post going viral on Hacker News. After being shared on
            Hacker News by someone, his website experienced a massive traffic
            spike that would make most website owners nervous.
         </p>

         <p>
            What caught my attention wasn't just the traffic surge but Manu's
            reflections on the broader question of online content sharing and
            the potential impact of sending unexpected waves of internet traffic
            to someone's website.

            <p>
               And so I’m wondering, if my site was big enough to cause
               problems, would then be my responsibility to be careful what I
               link to? Or should I just assume that other people out there know
               what they’re doing and I can keep linking without a second
               thought? My gut reaction tells me that it’s not really my
               responsibility to worry about the way other people run their
               sites but maybe I’m wrong and I should worry about that.

            ldstephens is a static site that runs on Netlify’s Free Plan. Here’s
            how it works:
         </p>

         <ul>
            <li>100 GB monthly bandwidth</li>
            <li>10 GB storage</li>
            <li>
               Progressive usage notifications at 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% of
               monthly limits
            </li>
            <li>Automatic site suspension if monthly limits are exceeded</li>
            <li>Quick upgrade option to continue site availability</li>
         </ul>

         <p>
            As you can see a Hacker News viral moment could use up 100 GB of
            bandwidth fairly easily and could potentially suspend my site until
            the next month.
         </p>

         <p>
            I think what Manu is asking is how I would feel if he shared one of
            my posts and it, for some reason, went viral and, exceeded my
            bandwidth limit and knocked my site offline. Would I feel that he
            had any responsibility? My answer is no. It’s my responsibility to
            manage my site, and he is welcome to share anything that I write,
            just as I’m sharing what he wrote in this post and responding to it.

        <div class="post-meta">Posted on April 9, 2024 by Loren</div>
        <p>Hey friends, I just discovered that Google's <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a> can summarize YouTube videos. This isn't something that I would do all that often but it could come in handy on occasion so I thought I would share it with you.</p>

        <p>If you're not familiar with Gemini it's a large language model Developed by Google AI similar to ChatGPT.</p>

        <p>Here's how it works:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Find your target video</li>
        <li>Copy the video URL</li>
        <li>Head to <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a></li>
        <li>Paste the copied YouTube video URL into the prompt field on the Gemini page. Then, type a clear instruction like “Summarize this video” or “What are the key points of this video?”</li>
        <li>Click submit and wait a few seconds. Gemini will analyze the video (using captions) and present you with a summary.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So, the next time you find a YouTube video that piques your interest but time is tight, give Gemini a try.</p>

         <p>
            I've been posting on
            <a href="https://ldstephens.medium.com">Medium</a> since 2015, and
            recently, I've noticed a significant increase in views. This uptick
            seems to be related to Google's shift towards AI-powered search
            results.
         </p>

         <p>
            Google's new search algorithm prioritizes content from platforms
            like Medium, Reddit, Stack Overflow, and Quora over traditional
            independent blogs. In the end, this trend is pretty fucking
            disheartening for independent bloggers.
         </p>

         <p>
            It feels like the unique, personal space of an independent blog is
            getting lost in the noise of the big platforms. For those of us who
            value independent blogging, itâ€™s a frustrating reminder that the
            rules of visibility online keep shifting and not in our favor.

        <h1>Independent blogs lost in search</h1>

        <p>I've been posting on <a href="https://ldstephens.medium.com">Medium</a> since 2015, and recently, I've noticed a significant increase in views. This uptick seems to be related to Google's shift towards AI-powered search results.</p>

        <p>Google's new search algorithm prioritizes content from platforms like Medium, Reddit, Stack Overflow, and Quora over traditional independent blogs. In the end, this trend is pretty fucking disheartening for independent bloggers. </p>
        
        <p>It feels like the unique, personal space of an independent blog is getting lost in the noise of the big platforms. For those of us who value independent blogging, itâ€™s a frustrating reminder that the rules of visibility online keep shifting and not in our favor.</p>

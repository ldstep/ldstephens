            Hey friends, I know many of you prefer mono fonts for writing and
            coding. I recently discovered a new mono-spaced font that you might
            be interested in. Macosguru

            about a new text editor he found and also mentioned that the app’s
            default font, Zed mono, was clean and well-designed.

            <p>
               <a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a> is a new text editor which is
               built around the collaboration between humans and AI. I am not
               interested in that particular activity but it is an interesting
               addition to the world of text editors. It is snappy, clean, and
               modern. I don’t have a need for it, having immersed myself in
               Emacs. But if you are looking for an editor, I would give this a
               shot.
            </p>

               Talking about Zed. I loved the fonts that the editor uses as
               default. They have made them available.<a

                  >The Zed Mono and Sans typefaces, custom built from Iosevka</a
               >. I can’t resist a free font, specially a well-designed, clean
               one. Get them to use in your editor of choice.

            Like Macosguru, I’m not interested in Zed’s text editor, but I did
            download the mono fonts. I’m currently typing this in MarkEdit using
            the Zed mono-spaced font, and I like it. I’m going to use it for a
            while and see if it sticks for me. Check out the Zed editor and Zed
            fonts for more information.

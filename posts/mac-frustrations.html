         <p>Hey friends, last Saturday I wrote this in my journal:</p>

         <h4>04 August 2024 10:56 AM</h4>

         <blockquote>

               Yesterday while writing on my MacBook I realized that Check
               Spelling While Typing was broken. I have no idea how it happened
               or for how long it had been broken. But it kinda pissed me off.
               Shit like that doesn't happen on iPadOS. I love my iPad. In many
               ways, macOS is fucking frustrating.
            </p>

            <p>
               I've committed to using my iPad only for the next week to see if
               I can get back in the swing of things to make my iPad my main
               computing device. I know that I can. It's just different.
            </p>

         <p>
            Now, after a full week of not touching my M1 MacBook Air, I’ve got
            some thoughts. The only out-of-the-ordinary thing I did was moving
            all my tasks from Things to Goodtask, which, honestly, was easier on
            my iPad than it would’ve been on my MacBook.
         </p>

         <p>
            I love my iPad, but it’s not going to replace my Mac. As I’ve
            realized before, I've got too many automations with Alfred, Keyboard
            Maestro, PopClip, Moom, and Hazel that are deeply ingrained in how I
            work. I just can’t make the switch.
         </p>

         <p>Oh, and by the way, I solved the issues with my Mac.</p>

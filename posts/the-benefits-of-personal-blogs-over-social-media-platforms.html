         <p>
            I've never been a big fan of social media platforms. In fact, I've
            never had a Facebook account. I tried Instagram when it was first
            introduced but canceled it shortly thereafter since I'm not a
            photography buff.
         </p>

         <p>
            I've had a Twitter account off and on since its inception. But
            honestly, I never found much value in it other than promoting my
            blog posts. Thanks to the shithead that now owns Twitter, I recently
            deleted my account again. Against my better judgment I just this
            week signed up for a new account only to promote my blog posts.
         </p>

         <p>
            I was reluctant to sign up for a Mastodon account but I finally
            caved in a little over a month ago. Like Twitter I don't find much
            value in Mastodon so for now I'm going to keep my account but I
            won't be active other than to promote my blog posts.
         </p>

         <p>
            What I find far better than social media are personal blogs. There
            are several benefits to following personal blogs rather than relying
            on social media platforms:

               <p>
                  Authenticity: Personal blogs are often more authentic than
                  social media posts. Bloggers write longer posts and share more
                  detailed stories about their lives or topics that interest
                  them, allowing me to get a better sense of who they are as
                  individuals.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Community: Many personal blogs have a strong community of
                  readers and followers who engage with the blogger and each
                  other. This creates a sense of belonging and connection that
                  may not be as strong on social media platforms.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Longevity: Blog posts are usually archived and can be accessed
                  at any time, whereas social media posts are often fleeting and
                  get buried in a user's feed within hours or days.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ol>

         <p>
            Overall, personal blogs provide me with a personalized, in-depth,
            and authentic experience that social media doesn't.

         <p>
            As a newcomer with little or no HTML or CSS experience, you're going
            to need guidance building your static site. While YouTube videos and
            Google searches offer fragmented advice, I found a more
            comprehensive approach using
            <a href="https://claude.ai/new">Claude AI</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            Claude helped me develop HTML and CSS templates. It provided
            accurate, actionable, and tailored advice that addressed my specific
            development needs. Claude transformed complex web development
            concepts into digestible, actionable steps. It also recommended
            using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a> for coding
            and <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> for hosting and
            walked me through setting it up via GitHub.
         </p>

         <p>
            You can do the same thing with ChatGPT but I found Claude to be more
            precise and helpful.

            <p>
               The more I look around the web the more I’m convinced we should
               all treasure our own tiny corners of the web. My site is
               precious. Precious for me. It is mine to do what I want. I can
               build it, I can destroy it, I can shape it, I can let it rot. I
               can change it or let it stay still. I can make it super busy or
               let it go dormant. I can make it welcoming or hostile. I’m in
               charge of all those decisions and no one can come here and tell
               me what I should do with it. The only moderation rules are the
               ones dictated by my morals and I own the responsibility of my
               words. My name is on it, my face is on it. I write and say the
               things I want to write and say at this very specific moment in
               time, based on the person I am and the things I believe in, and
               no one can force me to do otherwise. There’s something incredibly
               liberating about all this.

            I really appreciate what Manu wrote here. One big reason I moved
            ldstephens to a static site, besides the challenge of doing it, was
            that I didn’t want to continue relying on someone else’s platform
            and be stuck following their rules.

            My blog is mine. I built it myself, and I’m proud of that. I learned
            a lot along the way building it. Like Manu, I can do whatever the
            hell I want with it. It’s my little corner of the web.

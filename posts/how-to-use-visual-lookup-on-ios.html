         <p>
            Visual Lookup is a handy tool that you can use to identify and learn
            about plants, trees, insects, wildlife, pets, and more. I knew that
            there are apps for that but I didn&#8217;t know the iOS built-in
            camera also does it.
         </p>

         <p>
            I often see a plant, tree, animal, or bug on our property and wonder
            what it is. Now I know how to identify it.
         </p>

         <p>Steps:</p>

         <ol>
            <li>Take a photo of the object that you want to identify.</li>
            <li>
               Go to the Photos app and open the image you want to identify.
            </li>
            <li>
               Look for the info button. It looks like a small &#8220;i&#8221;
               or a star. It&#8217;s typically located at the bottom of the
               screen.
            </li>
            <li>
               Tap the info button. This will display details about the photo.
            </li>
            <li>
               Tap Look Up. This option will appear at the top of the photo
               information.
            </li>
            <li>
               Visual Lookup will provide information about the identified
               object, such as its name, species, or relevant details.
            </li>
         </ol>

        <p>Visual Lookup is a handy tool that you can use to identify and learn about plants, trees, insects, wildlife, pets, and more. I knew that there are apps for that but I didn&#8217;t know the iOS built-in camera also does it.</p>

        <p>I often see a plant, tree, animal, or bug on our property and wonder what it is. Now I know how to identify it.</p>

        <p>Steps:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Take a photo of the object that you want to identify.</li>
        <li>Go to the Photos app and open the image you want to identify.</li>
        <li>Look for the info button. It looks like a small &#8220;i&#8221; or a star. It&#8217;s typically located at the bottom of the screen.</li>
        <li>Tap the info button. This will display details about the photo.</li>
        <li>Tap Look Up. This option will appear at the top of the photo information.</li>
        <li>Visual Lookup will provide information about the identified object, such as its name, species, or relevant details.</li>
        </ol>

         <p>
            I've been using <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>,
            <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>
            for productivity and automation. Today it occurred to me that this
            is fucking silly! Why use three apps when I can do it all with one?
            With Alfred's built-in Features and 16 Workflows, I can do
            everything that I was doing in three.
         </p>

         <p>
            Don't get me wrong, Keyboard Maestro and Raycast are both wonderful
            apps. Buy I've realized that I don't need them any longer.

         <h1>When the Internet Goes Dark</h1>
         <div class="post-meta">Posted on March 11, 2023 by Loren</div>
         <p>I've been thinking about this a lot lately.</p>

         <p>
            Picture this: you wake up one day, pour yourself a cup of coffee,
            and sit down at your computer, ready to start your day. But as soon
            as you try to load up your favorite website, you're met with an
            error message. You try a few more sites, but nothing seems to be
            working. Suddenly, it hits you – the internet is down.
         </p>

         <p>
            At first, it might not seem like a big deal. You'll just have to
            find something else to do with your time for a little while, right?
            Wrong. It's a massive, extended internet outage, which will result
            in severe implications for our society.
         </p>

         <p>
            First of all, communication would be severely impacted. You wouldn't
            be able to send emails, use social media, or even video chat with
            your loved ones. Imagine having to resort to snail mail or – gasp! –
            actually talking on the phone to keep in touch with people. Oops!
            Who even has a fucking landline phone these days.
         </p>

         <p>
            With so many companies relying on the internet to conduct their
            operations, a prolonged outage could cause chaos and confusion.
            Online retailers, banks, and stock markets would all take a major
            hit. Can you even imagine the chaos that would ensue if people
            couldn't access their online bank accounts?
         </p>

         <p>
            And let's not forget about entertainment. The internet has
            revolutionized the way we entertain ourselves. Streaming videos and
            music online, playing games, and browsing social media have all
            become staples of our daily lives. Without the internet, we'd have
            to resort to other forms of entertainment – maybe even (gasp!)
            reading a book or going outside.
         </p>

         <p>
            Access to information would also be severely limited. The internet
            has made it easy to access vast amounts of information with just a
            few clicks. But without it, we'd have to rely on old-fashioned
            methods like books, newspapers, and TV news (cable only streamers
            are shit out of luck).
         </p>

         <p>
            A long-term internet outage would be no joke. It would completely
            upend our way of life and force us to adapt to a world without
            constant connectivity. So the next time you're cursing your internet
            provider for a shitty connection, just remember it could be worse.

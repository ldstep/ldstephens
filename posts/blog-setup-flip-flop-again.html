         <p>
            Yesterday, I decided to change the layout and design of this blog.
            Since it's a static site running on Netlify, making changes isn't
            always smooth. And, of course, I ended up breaking the fucking site.
         </p>

         <p>
            So today, I had to point the DNS back to Bearblog, where I keep a
            duplicate version for moments like this when I inevitably mess up
            the static site.
         </p>

         <p>
            For now (and maybe longer, depending on how things go), the blog is
            running on Bearblog until I get the new layout and design sorted.

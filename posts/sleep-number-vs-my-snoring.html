         <p>
            We recently got a Sleep Number bed. I snore, which makes it
            difficult for Lisa to sleep. The bed has a snore setting that
            automatically adjusts its position to help reduce snoring. When
            activated, it gently raises the head of the bed by a few degrees to
            open airways and improve breathing. So when I snore, Lisa can adjust
            my side of the bed until I stop.
         </p>

         <p>
            This morning, when I woke up, I was surprised to find myself almost
            upright. Lisa said she kept adjusting the bed until I quit
            snoring&#8211;and that was the position when I finally stopped. At
            this rate, I might as well start sleeping in a recliner.
         </p>

         <p>
            By the way, the Sleep Number bed has been wonderful for my lower
            back.

            I’ve been thinking a lot about the state of healthcare in America in
            light of the murder of the United Healthcare CEO. I have hesitated
            writing about how I feel about this situation, but this morning, I
            read Dave Rogers, Nice Marmot
            <a

               >blog post</a
            >
            about this very subject, so I thought I would say what I’m thinking.

               I hadn&#8217;t given a great deal of thought to how I feel about
               the murder of that CEO. (I&#8217;m not mentioning his name mostly
               because I can&#8217;t recall it at the moment; but also because I
               don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s worthy of _&#8220;Say his
               name!&#8221;_respect.)

               I <em>need</em> a laugh, and his are funny but also
               intelligent. <a

               >, which is significant because I&#8217;d been kind of going out
               of my way <em>not</em> to think about it. My reaction is that I
               don&#8217;t find much to disagree with in his comments.

            Before reading Dave’s post, I read a
            <a
               href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/what-the-murder-of-the-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-means-to-america"
               >New Yorker article</a
            >
            by Jia Tolentino, “What the Murder of the United Healthcare C.E.O.
            Means to America&quot; and I wanted to point out that United
            Healthcare denies 32% of insurance claims. Yep, nearly a third of
            claims submitted to this company are denied. That’s double the
            industry average, according to The New Yorker.
         </p>

         <p>
            The New Yorker quoted a person who posted on Reddit&#8217;s r/nurses
            forum, whose profile describes her as an I.C.U. nurse, wrote,
            &quot;Honestly, I&#8217;m not wishing anyone harm, but when
            you&#8217;ve spent so much time and made so much money by increasing
            the suffering of the humanity around you, it&#8217;s hard for me to
            summon empathy that you died”. Thompson, who became C.E.O. in 2021,
            had raised annual profits from twelve billion dollars to sixteen
            billion dollars during his tenure. He received more than ten million
            dollars in compensation last year.

         <p>
            Denying people the care they desperately need is fucking wrong and
            cruel. Yet, this level of corporate-driven harm has become so
            normalized in America that we barely blink at it.
         </p>

         <p>I'm conflicted about the whole thing.</p>

         <p>
            The other day I saved an article to
            <a href="https://goodlinks.app">Goodlinks</a> to read later. Today I
            decided to read it and discovered that the article is a 33 minute
            read. I didn’t want to take the time to read it right then, I
            thought that’s something that I would like to read on my Kindle
            Paperwhite while I’m in bed this evening<sup
               ><a
                  href="#fn1-27410"
                  id="fnr1-27410"
                  title="see footnote"
                  class="footnote"
                  >1</a
               ></sup
            >. The next question is how the hell do I get this article on my
            Kindle?
         </p>

         <p>
            It was easy. I opened the article on my iPhone and saved it to my
            Kindle via the share sheet save to Kindle. I wrote this to share a
            helpful tip I didn’t know about myself. If you’re interested in
            doing the same thing, I hope you find it useful!

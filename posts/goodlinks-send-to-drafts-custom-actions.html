            If you use <a href="https://goodlinks.app/">Goodlinks</a> and
            <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>, I hope you're taking
            advantage of Custom Actions. Custom Actions allow you to create your
            actions to export and share your saved bookmarks. Additionally, you
            can trigger URL schemes.
         </p>

            the following about Goodlinks:

         <blockquote>
            <p>
               I love Goodlinks as my read-it-later app. Even though I love it
               and think that it's the best reading experience of all
               read-it-later apps I’ve still been using Instapaper for its Share
               All Notes feature.
            </p>
         </blockquote>

         <p>
            In the latest release, version 1.8.5, Goodlinks introduced support
            for new custom action tags that are going to let me eliminate the
            need for Instapaper's Share All Notes: [selection-html],
            [selection-markdown], and [selection-text] on iOS and iPadOS. These
            tags will be handy as Goodlinks lacks a built-in highlighting and
            export highlights feature. Now, I can select text in an article and
            seamlessly send the selection to Drafts. This is especially handy
            for creating link posts.
         </p>

         <p>
            Here are my five most used Goodlinks send to Drafts actions, which
            include two new actions specifically for selected text:
         </p>

         <p><strong>Markdown Title, URL – Drafts</strong></p>

         <p><code>drafts://create?text={[}[title]{]}{(}[url]{)}</code></p>

         <p>
            This action sends the title and URL of the active article to Drafts
            as markdown.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Markdown Title, URL, Selection – Drafts</strong></p>

         <p>
            <code
               >drafts://create?text={[}[title]{]}{(}[url]{)}{
               }[selection-text]</code
            >
         </p>

         <p>
            This action sends the active article's title, URL, and selected text
            to Drafts as markdown.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Selection – Drafts</strong></p>

         <p><code>drafts://create?text=[selection-text]</code></p>

         <p>
            This action sends the selected text in the active article to Drafts
            as plain text.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Title, Author, URL, Selection – Drafts</strong></p>

         <p>
            <code
               >drafts://create?text={#
               }[title]%0A{*}[author]{*}%0A[url]%0A[selection-text]</code
            >
         </p>

         <p>
            This action sends the title, author, URL, and selected text in the
            active article to Drafts as plain text.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Markdown Title, URL, Summary – Drafts</strong></p>

         <p>
            <code
               >drafts://create?text={[}[title]{]}{(}[url]{)}{ }[summary]</code
            >
         </p>

         <p>
            This action sends the title, URL, and summary of the active article
            to Drafts as markdown.
         </p>

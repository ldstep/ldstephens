        <p>I have been using <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> since 2016 version 2. My Alfred workflows and muscle memory are so ingrained that moving to <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a> just isn’t an option. That said, I've got Raycast installed, and I'm currently using the free version, leveraging just two extensions that I find particularly useful.</p>

        <p>The first is the <strong><a href="https://www.raycast.com/extensions/reminders">Raycast Reminders</a></strong> extension. Here's what it does:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p>Create Reminders: You can create new reminders, add notes, set priority, and specify a due date. The due date can be expressed in natural language. For instance, you can say “Remind me tomorrow at 3 PM” to set a reminder for that time.</p></li>
        <li><p>My Reminders: This command lists all your uncompleted reminders. You can mark them as complete, set their priority, copy details, or open them in Apple's Reminder app.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The second is the <strong><a href="https://www.raycast.com/extensions/calendar">Calendar My Schedule</a></strong> extension. Here's what it does:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>My Schedule: View upcoming events for different time frames, from today's agenda to the weeks ahead. Search for specific events. No more calendar app hopping!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Alfred simply has nothing like these two extensions.</p>

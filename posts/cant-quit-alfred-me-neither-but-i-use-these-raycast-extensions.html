         <p>
            I have been using
            <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> since 2016 version
            2. My Alfred workflows and muscle memory are so ingrained that
            moving to <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a> just isn’t
            an option. That said, I've got Raycast installed, and I'm currently
            using the free version, leveraging just two extensions that I find
            particularly useful.
         </p>

         <p>
            The first is the
            <strong
               ><a href="https://www.raycast.com/extensions/reminders"
                  >Raycast Reminders</a
               ></strong
            >
            extension. Here's what it does:
         </p>

         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Create Reminders: You can create new reminders, add notes, set
                  priority, and specify a due date. The due date can be
                  expressed in natural language. For instance, you can say
                  “Remind me tomorrow at 3 PM” to set a reminder for that time.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  My Reminders: This command lists all your uncompleted
                  reminders. You can mark them as complete, set their priority,
                  copy details, or open them in Apple's Reminder app.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ul>

         <p>
            The second is the
            <strong
               ><a href="https://www.raycast.com/extensions/calendar"
                  >Calendar My Schedule</a
               ></strong
            >
            extension. Here's what it does:
         </p>

         <ul>
            <li>
               My Schedule: View upcoming events for different time frames, from
               today's agenda to the weeks ahead. Search for specific events. No
               more calendar app hopping!
            </li>
         </ul>

         <p>Alfred simply has nothing like these two extensions.</p>

            I&#8217;ve noticed that some bloggers I follow are switching from
            iOS to Android. I’m sure each of them has their reasons for doing
            so.
         </p>

         <p>
            I moved from Android to iOS 10 years ago. Android has probably
            changed a lot since then, but I don&#8217;t see myself ever
            returning. I left Android because I wanted to stop using Google
            services. In addition, iOS offered better security and privacy, and
            consistent OS updates.
         </p>

            recently switched to Android and offers some good advice for those
            who may be considering the switch. As I mentioned above, I stopped
            using Google services long ago and wouldn’t want to start again,
            which would be necessary with an Android phone.

            I was surprised to
            <a
               href="https://news.yahoo.com/lifestyle/wendys-start-testing-uber-style-094524758.html"
               >hear on the Today show</a
            >
            this morning that Wendy's is planning to test a dynamic pricing
            model, also referred to as “surge pricing,” in 2025. This means the
            prices of menu items will fluctuate based on several factors.
         </p>

         <ul>
            <li>
               Time of day: Prices might be higher during peak hours like lunch
               and dinner, and lower during off-peak times.
            </li>
            <li>
               Location: Prices might be adjusted based on the specific location
               and its customer base or demand.
            </li>
            <li>
               Overall demand: Similar to Uber's surge pricing, prices could
               increase if there's a sudden surge in demand for Wendy's food.
            </li>
         </ul>

         <p>
            The idea of fast food implementing surge pricing is bullshit. While
            companies have the right to set their own prices, this approach is
            nothing more than fucking consumers. It effectively means “we charge
            extra when you need us most”! Surge pricing at every level is
            nothing more than ripping off the consumer.

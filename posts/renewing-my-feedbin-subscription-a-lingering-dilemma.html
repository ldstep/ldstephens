         <h1>Renewing my Feedbin subscription: A lingering dilemma</h1>
         <div class="post-meta">Posted on November 19, 2023 by Loren</div>
         <p>
            My <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a> RSS service
            subscription is due for renewal in a few weeks, and I'm once again
            grappling with the decision of whether or not to continue.
         </p>

         <p>
            Last year, I reached a point where I couldn't tolerate Reeder's
            unreliable iCloud sync service any longer. It's iCloud sync has been
            plagued with issues since the 5.3.5 or 5.3.6 update, causing me
            endless frustration. To address this problem, I had two options:
         </p>

         <ol>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Subscribe to Feedbin, which works seamlessly with Reeder and
                  offers lightning-fast sync. However, this would incur an
                  annual $50 fee.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Switch to NetNewsWire, where iCloud sync works okay.</p></li>
         </ol>

         <p>
            My dilemma stems from my preference for Reeder over NetNewsWire. But
            is the convenience of Reeder worth the $50 annual Feedbin
            subscription?
         </p>

         <p>
            Now, I'm facing the same decision yet again. I've been testing
            iCloud sync on both Reeder and NetNewsWire. While Reeder's sync has
            improved, it still falls short of my expectations. NetNewsWire, on
            the other hand, performs okay but lacks the speed of Feedbin.
         </p>

         <p>
            I could conceivably adapt to using NetNewsWire and iCloud sync.
            However, I've been a loyal Reeder user since version 3 in 2016, and
            I genuinely adore the app. With a few weeks left before my decision
            deadline, I'm leaning towards renewing my Feedbin subscription and
            sticking with Reeder.

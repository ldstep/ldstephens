        <p>Hey friends, as you know, I’ve been experimenting with a static site. As of today, it’s this site is built entirely with <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com/">HTML and CSS</a> and hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. No complex server-side processing, databases, tracking scripts, cookies, or analytics—just a clean, straightforward site.</p>

        <p>I considered using a static site generator but decided it wasn’t necessary for something this simple. Right now, it’s still in a testing phase. I want to make sure everything’s working smoothly, including the RSS feed. If I hit any issues, I might need to move back to Bearblog.</p>
        
        <p>Let me know if you spot anything off.</p>

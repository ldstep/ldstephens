            Hey friends, as you know, I’ve been experimenting with a static
            site. As of today, it’s this site is built entirely with
            <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com/">HTML and CSS</a> and hosted on
            <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. No complex
            server-side processing, databases, tracking scripts, cookies, or
            analytics—just a clean, straightforward site.
         </p>

         <p>
            I considered using a static site generator but decided it wasn’t
            necessary for something this simple. Right now, it’s still in a
            testing phase. I want to make sure everything’s working smoothly,
            including the RSS feed. If I hit any issues, I might need to move
            back to Bearblog.
         </p>

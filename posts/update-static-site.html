         <p>
            First, a huge thank you to everyone who commented on my original
            post! After weighing the pros and cons, I've decided that BearBlog
            is where I'll stay.
         </p>
         <p>
            I gave building my static site a solid shot, creating it in raw HTML
            and CSS. But upkeep, adding new posts, and updating the feed.xml
            every time was just too tedious and error-prone. Sure, a static site
            generator could've made things easier, but I found them too complex
            for me to fully get comfortable with.
         </p>
         <p>
            Still, I learned a lot along the way, and it was absolutely worth
            the effort!
         </p>

         <p>
            I've used the free version of BBEdit starting back when the free
            version was TextWrangler. The only thing I used it for up to now was
            for the occasional time that I needed to write something in a plain
            text editor. When I decided to build a blog using html and css, I
            decided to pay for the full version of
            <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            Inspired by
            <a href="https://thejollyteapot.com/">Nicolas Magand</a>, now that I
            own the full version of BBEdit, I figured I should use it for
            writing markdown blog posts. Most markdown editors have keyboard
            shortcuts for bold, italic, and links, but not BBEdit. Since Nicolas
            switched from
            <a
               href="https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/09/27/the-wonderful-rabbit-hole-of-bbedit"
               >MarkEdit to BBEdit</a
            >
            I figured he must have figured something out for this. And, of
            course, he had:
         </p>

         <blockquote>
            <p>
               I can share with you a zip of the some of the script I have added
               to the Script folder of BBEdit, and now these actions are
               available in the Script menu, and therefore can be configured
               with a shortcut in the settings. Iâ€™ve recycled a few that I found
               online (from Dr Drang, Gruber, and more), and they work great.
            </p>
         </blockquote>

            And as he said, they work great! Now, in addition to building my
            blog in BBEdit, I can also write my blog posts. (Shit, I have to
            figure out how to end a sentence with double space for the period.
            That is a hard fucking habit to break.)
         </p>

         <p>Thank you for the help Nicolas!</p>

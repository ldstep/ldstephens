               >“The other day, I was getting frustrated with the iCloud sync of
               my RSS feeds in NetNewsWire. It works OK. It syncs between my
               phone and my computer, what else could I want? Well, it was a bit
               too slow for my taste, and not 100% reliable, so I subscribed to
               Feedbin just to make it smoother. It was not about convenience or
               efficiency, really; it was just about the details.”</em

         <p>
            Just yesterday I subscribed to Feedbin for the same reason. Besides
            offering a smoother experience, Feedbin keeps everything in sync
            across different apps. This means I can use Feedbin with NetNewsWire
            on my MacBook and Reeder on my iPhone and iPad, and my feed will
            always be up-to-date.

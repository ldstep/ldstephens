It works OK. It syncs between my phone and my computer, what else could I want? Well, it was a bit too slow for my taste, and not 100% reliable, so I subscribed to Feedbin just to make it smoother. It was not about convenience or efficiency, really; it was just about the details.”</em></p>

        <p>Just yesterday I subscribed to Feedbin for the same reason. Besides offering a smoother experience, Feedbin keeps everything in sync across different apps. This means I can use Feedbin with NetNewsWire on my MacBook and Reeder on my iPhone and iPad, and my feed will always be up-to-date.</p>

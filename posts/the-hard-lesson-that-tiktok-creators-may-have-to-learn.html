            As many creators know, the future of TikTok in the US hangs in the
            balance. A recent bill passed the House, requiring TikTok to sever
            ties with its parent company, ByteDance, or face a ban. This
            situation highlights a crucial lesson for all content creators:

               control!</strong
            >
         </p>

               >TikTok creators, advocates slam House bill, citing damage to the
               economy</a
            > “If the bill passes the Senate and becomes law, “I will lose my
            biggest platform as a content creator, stripped from me with no
            recompense or compensation,” she said.”

            When you build your career on someone else's platform like TikTok,
            Facebook, or YouTube, you expose yourself to several risks:
         </p>

         <p>
            These platforms hold immense power. They can change algorithms,
            restrict content, or even shut down entirely, jeopardizing your
            success and income. You're essentially building on someone else's
            land, and they can change the rules at any time. In this case, the
            government is in the process of changing the rules for TikTok.

            “Remember too: China itself bans all foreign social networks.
            Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Twitter/X, Pinterest — none of them
            are available in mainland China. It’s bananas that we allow an
            algorithmically-driven social media app controlled by China here.”

         <blockquote>
            <p>
               Security officials in the United Kingdom have demanded that Apple
               create a back door allowing them to retrieve all the content any
               Apple user worldwide has uploaded to the cloud.[…] The British
               government’s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires
               blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely
               assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known
               precedent in major democracies.[…] Rather than break the security
               promises it made to its users everywhere, Apple is likely to stop
               offering encrypted storage in the U.K., the people said. Yet that
               concession would not fulfill the U.K. demand for backdoor access
               to the service in other countries, including the United States.

            This is fucking crazy shit! If there’s a backdoor, hackers and
            cybercriminals will eventually find a way in, putting our security
            and privacy at serious risk. Our personal data could be stolen,
            leading to identity theft, financial fraud, and other attacks. It
            wouldn’t just be law enforcement using it—bad actors, including
            hackers and even foreign governments, could exploit the same
            weakness, violating users’ right to privacy and secure
            communication.

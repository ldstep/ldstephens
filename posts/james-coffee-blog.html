         <p>
            Hey friends, the other day, I was reading a blog post (wish I could
            remember whose!) about the indie web. It had several links, and I
            clicked one that took me to
            <a href="https://indieweb.org">indieweb.org</a>. While browsing
            there, I stumbled upon
            <a href="https://jamesg.blog">James’ Coffee Blog</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            What really hooked me was James’ content. It’s a mix of tech and
            personal topics. I spent some time exploring his site and found tons
            of interesting articles to dive into. Needless to say, James’ Coffee
            Blog is now part of my RSS feed!
         </p>

         <p>
            If you’re not already following James, check out his site. I think
            you’ll find it worthwhile.
         </p>

         <p>
            This is something that I highlighted while reading one of his
            <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/15/static-dynamic/">posts</a>.
         </p>

         <blockquote>
            <p>Having a static site is significant to me because:</p>

            <p>
               Static sites are fast (when engineered with performance in mind,
               of course!0. There is a significantly reduced admin tax. If my
               publishing tool goes down for any reason, my static site can
               still be available. I enjoy having folders of text files to edit:
               both markdown for posts and HTML for templates.
            </p>
         </blockquote>

         <p>
            I couldn’t agree more, static sites offer speed, simplicity, and the
            satisfaction of working directly with text files!

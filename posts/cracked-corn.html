            Feeding time around here is no joke! We go through 100 pounds of
            cracked corn every week to keep the deer and wild turkeys happy as
            they wander our 10-acre property. Our place is actually a Certified
            Wildlife Habitat with the state of New Jersey, and we love all the
            creatures that call it home.

            On top of that, we go through 40 pounds of birdseed for all the
            birds. Of course, the raccoon has figured out a little trickâ€”every
            night, it climbs the tree, hangs off the bird feeder, and dumps the
            seed just so it can feast. Smart little guy! I havenâ€™t spotted the
            groundhog yet this year, but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll make an appearance soon.

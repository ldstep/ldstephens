            On my walk the other day I was listening to John Gruber's
            <a href="https://overcast.fm/+B7NBTeKaY">The Talk Show podcast</a>.
            His guest was Jason Kottke who is celebrating the
            <a href="https://kottke.org/23/03/kottke-is-25-years-old-today"
               >25th anniversary</a
            >
            of his blog.
         </p>

         <p>
            John and Jason reminisced about the history of their blogs as well
            as the history of blogging in general. As I was listening I started
            thinking about my history of writing a blog and it goes something
            like this:
         </p>

         <p>
            The name of my blog is simply ldstephens. The first two letters are
            my first and middle initials and then my last name. I choose this
            because the domain Stephens wasn't available so I picked an
            available variation.
         </p>

         <p>
            When I decided to start a blog I knew that I wanted to blog about
            technology.
         </p>

         <p>
            I published my very first blog post on Medium in September 2015. In
            August of 2016, I decided to start blogging as ldstephens and moved
            to WordPress so that I could have my domain (ldstephens.net),
            identity, and place on the web. At this point, I cross-posted most
            of my posts to Medium.
         </p>

         <p>
            In 2021 I wanted to move away from WordPress and the block editor. I
            disliked the block editor because it took time to learn and get used
            to compared to the classic editor. It slowed down my editing
            process. I like writing content in markdown in one place and then
            posting it to WordPress, which is contrary to the block editor's
            “block” approach.
         </p>

         <p>
            So in 2021, I decided it was time to leave the WordPress platform.
            After a fair amount of research on blogging platforms, I settled on
            write.as. I wanted to keep the ldstephens name and settled on the
            domain ldstephens.me. I published my first post here in December
            2021 and I'm very happy here.
         </p>

         <p>
            All that said I've been doing this going on 8 years. I love doing it
            and plan to be doing it for as long as I can type on a keyboard. I
            don't have a huge audience but the one that I do has been loyal and
            I thank you all for that.

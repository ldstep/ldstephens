         <p>
            I recently discovered the “Open Link” option in the iPadOS
            right-click menu. When working in a text editor on iPadOS or iOS, I
            often deal with both words and links. Sometimes, I want to open one
            of those links in Safari. However, in a text editor, links aren't
            clickable for direct opening. What I discovered is that in iPadOS 16
            and iOS 16, if you select a link and right-click on it, the menu now
            includes an “Open Link” option.

            I assume you might already be aware of this feature, but for me, it
            was a new discovery.

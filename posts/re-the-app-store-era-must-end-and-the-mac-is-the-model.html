         <p>
            In his Macworld article,
            <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2525708">Jason Snell</a>
            makes a strong argument for why the Mac’s software ecosystem should
            be the model for iOS and iPadOS. Unlike iOS’s strict, App Store-only
            model, macOS has a more flexible approach to software distribution
            that has a balance between security and user freedom.
         </p>

         <p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>

         <ul>
            <li>
               App Store Apps: These are the most secure and Apple-approved,
               meeting strict standards. Macs can even be set to run only these
               apps, but it&#8217;s not the default.
            </li>
            <li>
               Notarized Apps: Developers can distribute apps outside the App
               Store by submitting them for an automated Apple scan. These apps
               are safer than fully unverified software, as Apple&#8217;s
               cryptographic signature ensures they&#8217;re untampered and from
               known developers.
            </li>
            <li>
               Non-Notarized Apps: These come with no Apple oversight, often
               from open-source or niche developers. While less secure,
               they&#8217;re still an option for users willing to take the risk.
            </li>
         </ul>

         <p>
            This system would let iOS and iPadOS users choose what they want
            without putting their safety at risk, just like Apple does on macOS.

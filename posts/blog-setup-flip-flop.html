         <p>
            Yesterday was a bit of a rollercoaster when it came to my blog
            setup. I started the day with a plan after reading Herman’s
            <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/manifesto/">Bear Manifesto</a>
            post: move ldstephens back to Bearblog. This change would reduce the
            friction associated with posting to a static site, and Bearblog
            would provide me with built-in analytics. Seemed like a win-win.
         </p>

         <p>
            Later in the afternoon, I tackled a necessary but tedious task in
            Bearblog—changing all the canonical links to alias and moved the DNS
            server setting to Bearblog.
         </p>

         <p>
            And then, plot twist! By the evening, I decided to move ldstephens
            back to Netlify. At the end of the day, I just love that I built
            this site myself. There’s something satisfying about knowing it's
            mine, running on my own setup.
         </p>

         <p>
            So, after all that back and forth, I'm right back where I started.
            But hey, sometimes you have to try something just to confirm that
            what you had was already the best fit.

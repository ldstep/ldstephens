                  charging stations, saying crooks have managed to hijack public
                  chargers that can infect devices with malware, or software
                  that can give hackers access to your phone, tablet or

                  >Avoid using free charging stations in airports, hotels or
                  shopping centers,” a tweet from the FBI’s Denver field office
                  said. “Bad actors have figured out ways to use public USB
                  ports to introduce malware and monitoring software onto
                  devices. Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an
                  electrical outlet instead.”</em

            on its website against using public WiFi for sensitive transactions,
            opening suspicious documents, using the same password for all
            accounts, and clicking unsolicited links in text messages and
            emails.

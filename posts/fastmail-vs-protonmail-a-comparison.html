         <p>
            If you’re searching for a private alternative to Google’s Gmail, you
            need to read this. I started using
            <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14726057">Fastmail</a> when
            I stopped using Gmail in 2015.

         <blockquote>
            <p>
               Fastmail, however, provides more of the features users expect
               from an email service, including an easy-to-use calendar and a
               powerful search function.
            </p>

            <p>
               Another huge difference that sets Fastmail apart is that it
               offers users the ability to create hundreds of aliases. This
               allows you to decide which email address is used for what. This
               increases the level of privacy and puts more control in your
               hands. Also, Fastmail’s customer service and support are quick to
               respond, friendly, and are email experts happy to apply their
               knowledge to your situation.

         <h2>Should I Migrate to a Static Site?</h2>

         <p>
            Over the last year, I've become increasingly interested in static
            sites. This led me to learn some basic HTML and CSS with the goal of
            recreating my current Bearblog site (ldstephens) as a static site,
            potentially hosting it on GitHub Pages. I've already completed
            building the new version, so the next step would be migrating all my
            existing posts.
         </p>

         <p>
            A major advantage of making this switch would be full ownership of
            my site, eliminating my dependency on Bearblog and its subscription.
            This would give me complete control over my content and hosting
            infrastructure.
         </p>

         <p>
            However, I'm facing two main concerns about making this transition:
         </p>

         <ol>
            <li>
               <p>
                  <strong>RSS Feed Impact</strong>: My primary concern is that
                  changing the RSS feed URL would cause me to lose my current
                  RSS followers, who make up the core of my audience.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  <strong>Broken Links</strong>: While all old links would break
                  after the migration, this is less concerning since I no longer
                  receive significant traffic from search results. My readership
                  primarily comes through RSS subscriptions.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ol>

         <p>
            I'd appreciate hearing from those who have undertaken similar
            migrations. What was your experience? How did you handle these
            challenges? Any insights would be valuable in helping me make this
            decision.

            The other day I came across David Kennedy’s blog and as I always do
            when I discover a new indie blog I read his About page and scanned
            his Archive for articles I might be interested in reading.
         </p>

         <p>
            David’s <a href="https://davidakennedy.com/blog/easy-websites/"
               >Easy Websites</a
            > post was a response to a post by Giles Turnbull “<a
               href="https://gilest.org/indie-easy.html"
               >Make the indie web easier</a
            >”.
         </p>

               We need more self-hosted platforms for personal publishing
               that <em>aren’t Wordpress</em>. And don’t point me to Hugo or
               Netlify or Eleventy or all those things - all of them are great,
               but none of them are simple enough. We need web publishing tools
               that do not require users to open the Terminal <em>at all</em>.
               And we need lots of them.

            Like David, I agree with Giles. I’ve been blogging in some form for
            over 20 years. Most of that time on WordPress.com.
         </p>

         <p>
            I used to love WordPress but in my opinion, it has become way too
            complicated to use for personal blogs. It’s especially complicated
            for someone just starting.
         </p>

         <p>
            If you’re wanting to get started with a personal blog I recommend <a
               href="https://pika.page/"
               >Pika</a
            >. I also like <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear</a> but it is a
            little more technical to get started.

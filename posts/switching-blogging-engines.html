            I just read Jack Bay’s post
            <a
               href="https://baty.net/2024/12/from-hugo-to-ghost-and-back-again/"
               >From Hugo to Ghost and back again</a
            >
            about how often he switches up his blogging engine.
         </p>

         <blockquote>
            <p>
               I can hear you all giggling. Ha ha very funny, Jack changed his
               blog again. I get it. Most normal people don’t change blogging
               engines every month or two.[…] Also, and maybe most importantly,
               I prefer static websites. The arguments in favor of static
               websites are enough, but they aren’t why I want a static site. It
               <em>feels</em> better having a static website. The actual
               publishing part can be a pain in the ass (:::cough::, Hugo) but
               the results are worth it. A folder full of HTML files and some
               images, starting on my local drive and synced to a simple web
               server…mmmmm, yummy.

         <p>
            This reminds me a bit of myself. You may have noticed that after
            switching this blog to a static site, I&#8217;ve moved it back to
            Bearblog and then back to static a couple of times over the last few
            weeks. Much like Jack, it just feels better to have a static
            website. I take pride in something I&#8217;ve built, and my content
            isn&#8217;t locked inside Bear.
         </p>

         <p>
            And yes, I agree &#8211; publishing with a static site is a pain in
            the ass, but it&#8217;s worth the extra effort.
         </p>

         <p>
            To stop the constant switching, I decided to close my Bear account.
            In the end, this entire site is just a folder full of HTML files on
            my SSD, synced to GitHub and hosted on Netlify.

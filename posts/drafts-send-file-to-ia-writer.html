         <p>
            <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> is my go-to app for
            capturing all my text-based ideas. Once I'm ready to turn those
            ideas into blog posts, I rely on Drafts actions to move them to
            <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, my preferred writing
            environment.
         </p>

         <p>
            Previously, I used a “Save files as” Drafts action, which involved a
            few cumbersome steps. First, I had to manually change the file
            extension from .txt to .md (Markdown format for blog posts). Then, I
            needed to navigate through Finder and select the specific folder
            (Ideas or Drafts) where I wanted to save the file. This process felt
            inefficient, and I wanted a more streamlined way to move my content
            directly to the target folder.
         </p>

         <p>
            To create an action to do exactly this requires using Drafts
            <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/bookmarks"
               >Bookmark</a
            >
            feature.
         </p>

         <blockquote>
            <p>
               A bookmark is a reference to a folder in the file system.
               Bookmarks allow you to grant permissions to work with files in
               folders that Drafts would not otherwise be able to access due to
               App Sandboxing security.”
            </p>

            <p>
               The
               <a
                  href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services#file"
                  >File action step</a
               >
               can be used to save content from Drafts to files. File action
               steps can be configured to use a Bookmark by selecting the
               “Bookmark” destination, and assigning a bookmark name.
            </p>

         <p>
            To get started, I installed the “Save to File in ‘Test’ Bookmark”
            action, which writes to a file named “Test” in a designated
            bookmark. I then customized the action for my needs, creating
            Bookmarks for both my Ideas and Drafts folders in Finder. With these
            actions in place, I can now save directly from Drafts to the desired
            folders. Since iA Writer mirrors these folder structures, the files
            automatically appear in the corresponding locations within iA
            Writer.

            I spend a lot of time on my iPads. One thing I would like to do more
            often is use my Apple Pencil for thinking and jotting down quick
            notes. But I didn’t because it doesn't fucking feel right. Paper is
            paper and pen on paper is something entirely different. What I
            discovered is that writing with the Pencil on iPad can feel more
            like pen and paper depending on the tool that you use.

            I recently read Thord Hedengren’s article “<a
               href="https://bored.horse/post/writing-on-glass/"
               >Writing on Glass – PenTips</a
            >” in line with this subject.

               I've tried two alternatives recently, and finally feel ready to
               mention them. Both are from an accessory maker called PenTips
               and, as the name implies, they focus on custom tips for your
               Apple Pencil. I actually went for their other option first
               however, which is a screen protector much like Paperlike and its
               ilk. […] Being that impressed with PenTips's magnetic matte
               screen protectors, I had to try their Apple Pencil tips. They're
               available in a wide variety, and sold in packs. That implies that
               these tips will wear out, and while I've yet to do that, I can
               see them being damaged in a bag for example. They're softer than
               the default Pencil tip, and rubbery to give more friction when
               touching the glass. It's not an identical feel, I don't think,
               and rather mushy in comparison at first, but you get used to it.
               Now, picking up a hard Apple Pencil tip feels weird against the
               glass. I prefer the PenTips to the screen protector variant
               because it lets me see the screen as it's meant to be.

            On Thord’s recommendation, I ordered a box of
            <a
               href="https://pen.tips/collections/pentips/products/pentips_2_plus"
               >3 – PenTips 2 Plus</a
            >.
         </p>

         <p>
            My PenTips arrived a little over a week ago. Excited I opened the
            box and immediately put one of the tips on my Apple Pencil and
            started doodling in GoodNotes. The PenTips added texture, reducing
            the slipperiness, and provided a more paper-like feel, which
            improved my precision and control while writing with the Apple
            Pencil.

        <h1> iPhone Notes Missing After Accepting New iCloud Terms? Here’s the Fix!</h1>
        <div class="post-meta">Posted on November 7, 2024 by Loren</div>
        <p>Hey friends, Apple recently updated their iCloud terms and conditions, and apparently, after accepting these new terms, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/how-to-fix-iphone-notes-disappearing/">some iPhone users opened their Notes app to find all their notes gone</a>! Luckily, I didn’t experience this myself, but some people are having this issue, and I wanted to share a simple fix to help you get those notes back if you’re one of them.</p>

        <p>The Fix:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Open the Settings app.</li>
        <li>Tap your name at the top (Apple Account settings).</li>
        <li>Select iCloud.</li>
        <li>Tap Notes.</li>
        <li>Ensure Sync this iPhone is on (toggle it off and back on if it’s already enabled).</li>
        <li>Open the Notes app and wait a few minutes for your notes to reappear.</li>
        </ol>

            Hey friends, I want to give a shout-out to
            <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>! It’s the best $20 bucks
            I spend every year. I first installed Drafts in 2014, when it was
            only available on iOS. Then, in 2019, Drafts came to the Mac. Drafts
            is my all-time favorite app and is where every bit of text starts:
            blog ideas, random thoughts, notes, you name it.
         </p>

         <p>
            Whenever I have an idea or a thought, I immediately open Drafts and
            save it. It’s my go-to for quick note-taking. I use it to outline,
            draft, and format all my blog posts in Markdown. I keep everything
            organized with tags and workspaces. It’s also my personal
            information dump; with its amazing search, Drafts serves as my
            central repository for all the random bits of info I collect. On top
            of that, I’ve set up custom actions that let me do just about
            anything with my text: sending it to other apps, emailing it, saving
            it as a file, formatting it, and more.
         </p>
         <p>
            If you’ve never tried Drafts, you gotta give it a try. There’s a
            free version to get you started.

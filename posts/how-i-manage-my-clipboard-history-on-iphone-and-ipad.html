            Hey friends, I was hoping for a clipboard manager in iOS and iPadOS
            18. But we didn’t get one. This was no big deal for me because,
            though. I’ve had a clipboard history manager for iOS since, I think,
            around 2018 or 2019.
         </p>

         <p>
            I know you’re thinking, how is that possible? It’s a little-known
            clipboard monitoring feature in
            <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/ios/">Yoink</a>. I can’t
            tell you how handy it is to have a clipboard history available,
            particularly when I’m using my iPad.
         </p>

         <p>
            Yoink leverages Picture-in-Picture (PiP) to secretly monitor your
            clipboard. This lets it stay active even when you close the app. To
            activate clipboard monitoring, tap the "+" button, then "Monitor
            Clipboard," and select a timeout or "No Timeout." You'll need to
            confirm your choice.
         </p>

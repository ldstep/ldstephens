        <p>Hey friends, I was hoping for a clipboard manager in iOS and iPadOS 18. But we didn’t get one. This was no big deal for me because, though. I’ve had a clipboard history manager for iOS since, I think, around 2018 or 2019. </p>

        <p>I know you’re thinking, how is that possible? It’s a little-known clipboard monitoring feature in <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/ios/">Yoink</a>. I can’t tell you how handy it is to have a clipboard history available, particularly when I’m using my iPad.  </p>
        
        <p>Yoink leverages Picture-in-Picture (PiP) to secretly monitor your clipboard. This lets it stay active even when you close the app. To activate clipboard monitoring, tap the "+" button, then "Monitor Clipboard," and select a timeout or "No Timeout." You'll need to confirm your choice.</p>

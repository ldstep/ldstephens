            I&#8217;ve been using GitHub all wrong for this site. Instead of
            working from a cloned repository, I was just using a regular folder
            of files on my computer. Whenever I wanted to add a new post or make
            changes, I&#8217;d edit them in VS Code, then drag and drop the
            updated files directly into GitHub&#8217;s web interface. I knew
            this wasn&#8217;t the right way to do it, but I didn&#8217;t know
            any better. So, I started searching YouTube for a better way to
            handle it.
         </p>

         <p>
            I came across this video
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8rSLsi1xo"
               >GitHub Tutorial - Beginner&#8217;s Training Guide - YouTube</a
            >
            that helped immensely.

            What I needed to do was install GitHub Desktop and I needed to clone
            the repository locally.
         </p>

         <p>
            Now GitHub Desktop connects GitHub, my local repository, and VS Code
            together. Here&#8217;s how it works:
         </p>

         <ol>
            <li>
               <strong>Connecting to GitHub</strong>: GitHub Desktop links
               directly to my GitHub account, so I can easily clone repositories
               and sync my changes with the remote repositories on GitHub.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Managing My Local Repository</strong>: When I clone a
               repository using GitHub Desktop, it creates a local copy on my
               computer. This is where I make changes and commit updates.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Using Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</strong>: I&#8217;ve
               set VS Code as my default editor in GitHub Desktop. When I click
               &#8220;Open in Visual Studio Code,&#8221; it opens my local
               repository in VS Code, ready for me to start coding.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Keeping Everything in Sync</strong>:</li>
         </ol>

         <ul>
            <li>I write and edit my code in <strong>VS Code</strong>.</li>
            <li>
               GitHub Desktop tracks the changes I make and lets me commit them.
            </li>
            <li>
               Once I&#8217;ve committed, I can push my changes to GitHub or
               pull updates from the remote repository when needed.
            </li>
         </ul>

         <p>
            Honestly, taking the time to learn GitHub Desktop has made managing
            my static site so much easier. I can jump into VS Code to edit,
            track changes locally, and sync it all with GitHub in just a couple
            of clicks. It&#8217;s been a fucking game-changer.

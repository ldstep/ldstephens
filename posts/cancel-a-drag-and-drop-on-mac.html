            While walking this morning and listening to ATP episode 614, the
            subject of how to cancel a drag and drop came up again. Of course,
            <a href="https://hypercritical.co/about/">John Siracus</a> knew the
            answer. I didn’t. I was glad to learn the answer because there have
            been times that I have started a drag and drop to move files to a
            different folder, and for some reason, it gets fucked up (user error
            missing the target folder), and I always panic and want to end the
            drag and drop.
         </p>

         <p>
            According to John, all you need to do is
            <b>use the escape key</b>. I tested it and it works.
         </p>

         <p>Thanks, John!</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.404media.co/police-freak-out-at-iphones-mysteriously-rebooting-themselves-locking-cops-out/">404 Media reported</a> that law enforcement officials were freaking out that iPhones which had been stored for examination were mysteriously rebooting themselves. At the time the cause was unclear, with the officials only able to speculate why they were being locked out of the devices. Now a day later, the potential reason why is coming into view.</p>
          
        <p>“Apple indeed added a feature called ‘inactivity reboot’ in iOS 18.1.,” Dr.-Ing. Jiska Classen, a research group leader at the Hasso Plattner Institute, <a href="https://x.com/naehrdine/status/1854896392797360484?ref=404media.co">tweeted after 404 Media published</a> on Thursday along with screenshots that they presented as the relevant pieces of code.</p>

            Hey friends, have you ever wanted to scan a document and have it
            scan to “text” instead of PDF or JPEG? Well, now you can with Simple
            Scan.
         </p>

            <a href="https://agiletortoise.com/simple-scan/">Simple Scan</a> by
            Greg Pierce of Agile Tortoise is a portable scanner app for iPhones.
            It allows you to capture high-quality scans of papers, receipts, and
            photos with just a few taps. You can save your scans as PDF or JPEG
            files and easily share them via email or cloud services. In addition
            to PDF or JPEG with
            <a href="https://agiletortoise.com/simple-scan/changelog"
               >version 5</a
            >
            you can now <strong>scan to text</strong> “<em
               >“Text” format option shares on the text recognized by optical
               character recognition as plain text. This can be output to a text
               file, or shared to other applications as text.</em
            >“
         </p>

         <p>
            I have a workflow where I can scan a document to “text” and share it
            directly into <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> Greg's
            other great app.

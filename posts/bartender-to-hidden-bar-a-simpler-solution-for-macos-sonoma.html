         <p>
            Hey, friends! I've been a long-time user of Mac Bartender, an
            application for macOS that helps you organize and customize your
            menu bar, simplifying the management of icons and notifications for
            a cleaner and more efficient desktop experience.
         </p>

         <p>
            With macOS Sonoma, upgrading from Bartender version 4 to the new
            version 5 is necessary. While I don't mind paying for the upgrade,
            each iteration of Bartender adds features that I don't find
            necessary, and the same holds true for version 5. So, as I said, I
            don't mind the upgrade cost, but the app now offers more features
            than I actually need. That's why I'm giving Hidden Bar from
            Superbits, a simpler solution, a try. In the end, it provides the
            basic features I need and nothing more.

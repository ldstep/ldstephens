            on Pluralistic “You should be using an RSS reader” explains how RSS
            can help you reclaim your online experience from the
            enshittification of social media. He goes into detail on how RSS, or
            Really Simple Syndication, is a simple yet effective way to curate
            your own, ad-free feed of the web's best content. With an RSS
            reader, you can follow your favorite news sources, blogs, and even
            social media accounts, all in one place. No more endless scrolling
            through irrelevant content you see what you want, when you want.

               And then I had a realization: the conduit through which I
               experience Molly's excellent work is totally
               enshittification-proof, and the more I use it, the easier it is
               for everyone to be less enshittified.
            </p>

            <p>
               This conduit is anti-lock-in, it works for nearly the whole
               internet. It is surveillance-resistant, far more accessible than
               the web or any mobile app interface. It is my secret super-power.
            </p>

            <p>It's RSS.</p>

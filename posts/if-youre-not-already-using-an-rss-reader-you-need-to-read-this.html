        <p>Cory Doctorow in his <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/">latest post</a> on Pluralistic “You should be using an RSS reader” explains how RSS can help you reclaim your online experience from the enshittification of social media. He goes into detail on how RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, is a simple yet effective way to curate your own, ad-free feed of the web's best content. With an RSS reader, you can follow your favorite news sources, blogs, and even social media accounts, all in one place. No more endless scrolling through irrelevant content you see what you want, when you want.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>And then I had a realization: the conduit through which I experience Molly's excellent work is totally enshittification-proof, and the more I use it, the easier it is for everyone to be less enshittified.</p>
        
        <p>This conduit is anti-lock-in, it works for nearly the whole internet. It is surveillance-resistant, far more accessible than the web or any mobile app interface. It is my secret super-power.</p>
        
        <p>It's RSS.</p>

        <p>Do your self a favor and <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/">read the article</a> from start to finish. You’ll be glad you did.</p>

            While sitting at my desk the other day, I realized it was time to
            streamline my RSS reading routine. I was constantly bouncing between
            apps: Reeder as my RSS client, Goodlinks for saving articles to read
            later, and Omnivore for highlighting and listening to articles.
         </p>

         <p>
            This juggling act felt inefficient. I decided to centralize
            everything in <a href="https://www.reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>. With
            Reeder's built-in Read Later functionality and its integration with
            <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, I can now
            manage all my reading needs in one place. I added my Instapaper
            account to Reeder as a “save to location,” allowing me to also read
            my saved Instapaper articles directly within Reeder.
         </p>

         <p>
            But that's not all! By opening an article in Instapaper for
            highlighting, and thanks to the new
            <a
               href="https://blog.instapaper.com/post/748647273401139200/summaries-custom-article-actions-obsidian"
               >Obsidian plugin for Instapaper</a
            >, my highlights will effortlessly flow into Obsidian. This new
            approach promises a smoother, more integrated reading experience!

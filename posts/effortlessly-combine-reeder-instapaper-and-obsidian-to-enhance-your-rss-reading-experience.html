        <p>While sitting at my desk the other day, I realized it was time to streamline my RSS reading routine. I was constantly bouncing between apps: Reeder as my RSS client, Goodlinks for saving articles to read later, and Omnivore for highlighting and listening to articles.</p>

        <p>This juggling act felt inefficient. I decided to centralize everything in <a href="https://www.reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>. With Reeder's built-in Read Later functionality and its integration with <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, I can now manage all my reading needs in one place. I added my Instapaper account to Reeder as a “save to location,” allowing me to also read my saved Instapaper articles directly within Reeder.</p>

        <p>But that's not all! By opening an article in Instapaper for highlighting, and thanks to the new <a href="https://blog.instapaper.com/post/748647273401139200/summaries-custom-article-actions-obsidian">Obsidian plugin for Instapaper</a>, my highlights will effortlessly flow into Obsidian. This new approach promises a smoother, more integrated reading experience!</p>

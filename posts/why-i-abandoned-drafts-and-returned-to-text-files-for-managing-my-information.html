         <p>
            In a recent
            <a
               href="https://medium.com/@ldstephens/back-to-drafts-app-as-my-information-repository-1650876c7c72"
               >blog post</a
            >, I discussed my decision to switch back to
            <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> as my primary
            information repository. While this move has proven beneficial, there
            was one lingering concern: the potential for data loss due to
            database corruption or iCloud taking a shit. To address this
            concern, I adopted the practice of saving all information in both
            Drafts and text files. However, maintaining synchronization between
            the database and files has become a constant challenge.
         </p>

         <p>
            After careful consideration, I concluded that storing information in
            both Drafts and text files was an unnecessary redundancy. Since I am
            unwilling to abandon text files, I decided to eliminate Drafts as an
            information repository and rely solely on text files for data
            storage.
         </p>

         <p>
            To implement this change, I have consolidated all my text files
            within the <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> library.
            Drafts now serves as a temporary workspace for short-term notes and
            text capture, with permanent information residing in text files
            accessible from any text editor. Additionally, I have integrated
            <a href="https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/?lang=en">HoudahSpot</a>
            search to facilitate efficient information retrieval.
         </p>

         <p>
            I am confident that this simplified system will serve my information
            management needs.

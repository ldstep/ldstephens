               No matter the case, ads on the web will always be tricky and live
               in this bizarre gray area. And until someone comes up with a
               really compelling argument for allowing ads I'll keep running
               ad-blockers because I just can't stand ads.

            Ah, web ads, the unsolicited guests that never fucking leave. I have
            been using an ad-blocker since they were first available to
            consumers. My blocker of choice for Safari is
            <a href="https://kaylees.site/wipr.html">Wiper</a> and
            <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> for Firefox.
         </p>

         <p>
            As a side note, I'm also annoyed by websites that bug me with a
            popup to sign to receive their email. You know who you are so stop
            it already.

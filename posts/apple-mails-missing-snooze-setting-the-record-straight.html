         <p>
            Fortunately, Apple’s built-in Mail app has become pretty feature
            complete over the years. Though the latest email features take a
            year or two to show up in Mail, most have made their way into the
            app — features like Send Later, Snooze, Undo Send, and more are now
            all in Apple’s default Mail app and available to all iPhone, iPad,
            and Mac users.
         </p>

            I use Apple Mail but I want to point out one misleading statement in
            this paragraph. Apple Mail does not have snooze! It's a feature that
            I wish it had. It does have Remind Me Later which is very different:
         </p>

         <p><strong>Snoozed email</strong></p>

         <p>
            Moves the email to a Snooze folder until the specified time. ￼The
            email is still visible in the Snooze folder, so you can easily find
            it and take action if needed. ￼If someone replies to a snoozed
            email, it will be un-snoozed and moved back to your inbox.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Remind Me Later</strong></p>

         <p>
            Creates a reminder for the email, but the email remains in your
            inbox. You can set a specific date and time for the reminder, or you
            can choose to be reminded at a later time, such as when you arrive
            at a specific location or when you complete another task. If someone
            replies to a reminded email, the reminder will remain active, but
            the email will be moved to the top of your inbox.
         </p>

         <p>I find Remind Me Later to be useless.</p>

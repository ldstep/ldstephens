               macOS Sequoia introduces another new feature labelled Help Apple
               Improve Search, which sends and stores various search queries
               from Safari, Spotlight, and other sources to improve search
               results.
            </p>

            <p>
               This feature, too, is enabled by default and is well hidden at
               the very bottom of System Settings &gt; Spotlight.
            </p>

            It turns out that I had disabled this setting on my iPhone, and iPad
            but not on my Mac so I disabled it.

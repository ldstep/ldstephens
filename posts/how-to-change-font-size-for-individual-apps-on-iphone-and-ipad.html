            Most iPhone and iPad users are familiar with the option to change
            font size in Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Phone, Notes, and other apps
            that support Dynamic Type. To do this, simply go to Settings &gt;
            Display &amp; Brightness, then choose Text Size and use the slider
            to select your preferred font size. However, many might not know how
            to adjust font size in an individual app.
         </p>

         <p>
            Yesterday, I encountered a situation where I needed to change the
            font size in a specific app that utilizes Dynamic Type. I wanted to
            modify the font size in
            <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com">Goodnotes</a> without affecting
            other apps. It took me a few minutes to recall the process, but you
            can indeed change font size for individual apps on your iPhone or
            iPad by following these steps:
         </p>

         <ol>
            <li>Open the app for which you want to change the font size.</li>
            <li>
               Open the Control Center by swiping down from the top-right corner
               of your screen. For iPhones with a Home button, swipe up from the
               bottom of the screen.
            </li>
            <li>Tap the Text Size icon.</li>
            <li>If the All Apps icon is blue, tap the [This App] Only icon.</li>
            <li>
               Use your finger to move the slider up or down to change the font
               size for the app.
            </li>
         </ol>

         <p>
            The more white bars, the larger the font size. Look at the top of
            the screen for a preview of the actual size of the font.
         </p>

         <p>I hope this helps!</p>

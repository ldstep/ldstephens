         <p>
            My note-taking system was a chaotic mess. Determined to get
            organized, I cleaned it up.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Breaking Up with Apple Notes</strong></p>

         <p>
            Apple Notes offered initial convenience, but exporting notes was
            limited to PDFs. I wanted the flexibility of having my notes in
            accessible files, not a closed-off database.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Decluttering and Consolidation</strong></p>

         <p>
            The first step involved a purge of obsolete and unused notes in
            Apple Notes, slashing the count from a 260 to 69. These remaining
            notes were then imported into my Obsidian vault, where they were
            merged with my existing note files. This consolidation means all my
            notes now reside as individual files within Finder.
         </p>

         <p><strong>A Streamlined Filing System</strong></p>

         <p>
            For optimal organization, all my files organized in Finder in 3 main
            folders:
         </p>

         <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>My File Cabinet:</strong> This folder is for all my
               critical documents.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>My Obsidian Vault:</strong> This folder houses all my
               notes and highlighted excerpts.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Writing:</strong> This folder is a central repository for
               all my writing projects and archived material.
            </li>
         </ul>

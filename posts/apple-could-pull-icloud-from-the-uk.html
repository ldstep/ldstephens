            Hey friends, I know many of you who read my posts are in the U.K.
            You may have already read this. Quoting
            <a
               href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/could-apple-pull-icloud-services-from-uk/"

            <em
               >“A more dramatic response from Apple would involve completely
               removing iCloud services from the UK. While this would protect
               Apple's encryption standards, it would severely disrupt millions
               of UK users who rely on iCloud for photo storage, device backups,
               and document syncing. Users would need to find alternative cloud
               storage solutions and potentially lose access to years of
               accumulated data.”</em

            Are you concerned about this possibility?

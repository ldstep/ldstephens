            <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a>? It stands for
            &quot;Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere&quot; -
            basically where you post stuff on your site first, then share it
            around on social media and whatnot, always linking back to your
            original post.

            Thing is, I've been wondering if I should be doing this. And for me,
            it's clearly no. Since I don't use social media, why would I want to
            put my blog posts there? Sure, maybe I'd pick up a few more RSS
            subscribers, but that's not why I'm blogging in the first place.

            My blog is its own thing. It’s mainly just a place to get my
            thoughts out there. My RSS followers are my people, and I pick up
            new ones now and then when other bloggers link to something I wrote.
            And that’s perfectly fine with me.

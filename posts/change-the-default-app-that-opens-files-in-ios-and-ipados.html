            Since the new iPads were introduced a couple of weeks ago there has
            been a lot of chatter about what one can and can't do on an iPad.
            One of the complaints I encountered was about not being able to set
            a default app to open certain file types in iPadOS. You know one of
            those posts about why someone can't use an iPad.
         </p>

         <p>
            Well, there is a way sorta. Let's take a .txt file. The most common
            files that regular users have are .txt .md or .pdf. The last app to
            open a file type will be the default until you open it with a
            different app. Here's how it works:
         </p>

         <p>
            For example, to change the default app that opens a .txt file on
            your iPad, follow these steps:
         </p>

         <ol>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Open the Files app and find the .txt file you want to change
                  the default app for.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Tap and hold the .txt file until a menu appears, then select
                  “Share.”
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  In the share sheet, you’ll see a list of apps that can open
                  the .txt file. Choose the app you want to use.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  The file will open in the selected app. From now on, whenever
                  you open a .txt file, your iPad will remember this preference.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ol>

         <p>
            My preference for .txt and .md files is to open in 1Writer and .pdf
            files to open in the default Preview in iPadOS.
         </p>

         <p>
            Remember, iOS doesn’t have a universal way to set a default app for
            file types, but this method works for accessing files with your
            preferred app. This works the same way in iOS on iPhone.

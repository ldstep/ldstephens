         <p>
            As someone who spends a considerable amount of time consuming and
            sharing information on the web, I understand the importance of
            optimizing the process. Fortunately, through the use of right tools
            and workflows, I have been able to streamline this process. So I
            thought I would share it with you today.
         </p>

         <p>My workflow consists of the following steps:</p>

         <ol>
            <li>
               <p>
                  <strong>Reading</strong>: I Use
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> feeds with
                  <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a>,
                  <a href="https://www.reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>, and
                  <a href="https://goodlinks.app/">Goodlinks</a>. Goodlinks is
                  for reading-later.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  <strong>Linking</strong>: Once I am ready to start capturing
                  ideas and writing, I use
                  <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>, a powerful app
                  that allows me to quickly capture my thoughts and ideas.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  <strong>Writing</strong>: Drafts is where I write and publish
                  shorter posts, and for longer pieces, I export my ideas to
                  <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>. iA Writer lets
                  me better organize and structure my content before publishing.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ol>

         <p>
            By using these tools and workflows, I have been able to reduce the
            time and effort it takes to stay informed and share information with
            you my faithful readers.

            Checking analytics for ldstephens, it appears to receive relatively
            few direct page views. This can sometimes be discouraging. However,
            I must keep in mind that my target audience isn’t solely comprised
            of direct visitors but rather the 360+ RSS followers who are most
            likely to read my posts through their RSS reader app.

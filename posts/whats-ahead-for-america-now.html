            I went to bed at my normal time last night. I didn't want to stay up
            and watch the election results come in. I expected a Harris win. I
            didn't want to be stressed watching the results come in. I figured I
            would just get the results when I woke up this morning. Harris
            didn't win. Trump won the electoral college and it's looking like
            the popular vote as well.

            As a result of this election, the United States will become a
            different kind of country. We have a Republican-controlled Supreme
            Court, Senate, and perhaps the House as well. With that, the
            Republicans will be unconstrained with their agenda.
         </p>

         <p>
            The big question is will we be better off or worse off after another
            four years of Trump?

        <p>I went to bed at my normal time last night. I didn't want to stay up and watch the election results come in. I expected a Harris win. I didn't want to be stressed watching the results come in. I figured I would just get the results when I woke up this morning. Harris didn't win. Trump won the electoral college and it's looking like the popular vote as well.</p>

        <p>As a result of this election, the United States will become a different kind of country. We have a Republican-controlled Supreme Court, Senate, and perhaps the House as well. With that, the Republicans will be unconstrained with their agenda.</p>
        
        <p>The big question is will we be better off or worse off after another four years of Trump? </p>

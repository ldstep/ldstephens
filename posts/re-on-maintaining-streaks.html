            <p>
               A few years ago, I participated in #100DaystoOffload and the
               longer it went on, the quality of my posts suffered. I stopped
               writing because I had something to say, instead, I wrote to keep
               the streak alive and in doing so I was doing myself and my
               readers a disservice.
            </p>

            <p>I now approach things with “dailyish” in mind.</p>

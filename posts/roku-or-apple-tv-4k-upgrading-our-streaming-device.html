            Our trusty old JVC TV, while not a smart one, is and has been a good
            TV. It was paired with an equally old Roku that had been giving us
            problems lately. Since the TV itself was still working fine, we
            decided to upgrade the streaming device. This led us to Roku or
            Apple TV 4K.

         <p>
            One deciding factor was the growing frustration with all the fucking
            ads on Roku. Then I came across this article
            <a
               href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/04/16/roku-eyes-patent-that-would-inject-ads-into-everything/"
               >Roku Eyes Patent That Would Inject Ads Into… Everything |
               Techdirt</a
            >
            and that solidified our decision to move away from Roku.
         </p>

         <p>
            Enter the Apple TV 4K. The speed is fantastic, and the ability to
            control the TV with my iPhone is a game-changer. No more frantic
            searching for the remote! We love our new Apple TV 4K!

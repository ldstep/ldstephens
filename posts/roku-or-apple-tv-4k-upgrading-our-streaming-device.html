        <p>Our trusty old JVC TV, while not a smart one, is and has been a good TV. It was paired with an equally old Roku that had been giving us problems lately. Since the TV itself was still working fine, we decided to upgrade the streaming device. This led us to Roku or Apple TV 4K.</p>

        <p>One deciding factor was the growing frustration with all the fucking ads on Roku. Then I came across this article <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/04/16/roku-eyes-patent-that-would-inject-ads-into-everything/">Roku Eyes Patent That Would Inject Ads Intoâ€¦ Everything | Techdirt</a> and that solidified our decision to move away from Roku.</p>

        <p>Enter the Apple TV 4K. The speed is fantastic, and the ability to control the TV with my iPhone is a game-changer. No more frantic searching for the remote! We love our new Apple TV 4K!</p>

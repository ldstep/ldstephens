            <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> is the most used app
            on my Mac. Over the years I've written several articles about how I
            use it <a href="https://ldstephens.net/?s=alfred">here</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            I use Alfred's built-in
            <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/clipboard/"
               >Clipboard History</a
            >
            and occasionally I want to delete a specific clipboard item. I
            couldn't figure out how to do it or if I even could. I googled for
            an answer and found that Fn + Backspace will delete individual
            items. Okay, where and the hell is the Backspace key on a Mac
            keyboard? I'm sure that 99.9% of you probably already know the
            answer but I didn't. The Backspace key on a Mac is the Delete key.
            So to delete an individual clipboard history item in Alfred you use
            Fn + Backspace (delete key).

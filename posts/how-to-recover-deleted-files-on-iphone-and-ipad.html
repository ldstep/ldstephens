            Have you accidentally deleted a file on your iPhone or iPad? It can
            be super frustrating, especially if the file was important. But
            don't worry, it's super easy to recover deleted files using the
            Recently Deleted feature in the Files app.
         </p>

         <p>
            Recently Deleted in the Files app is kinda like the Trash on a Mac.
            When you delete a file, it goes into the Recently Deleted folder
            where it hangs out for 30 days before being permanently deleted.
            This gives you a chance to recover the file if you change your mind.
            When you delete a file, it goes into the Recently Deleted folder
            where it stays for 30 days before being permanently deleted. This
            gives you a chance to recover the file if you change your mind.
         </p>

         <ol>
            <li>Open the Files app and tap on “Browse”</li>
            <li>Tap on “Recently Deleted” under “Locations”</li>
            <li>Tap on the deleted file you want to recover</li>
            <li>Tap on “Recover”</li>
         </ol>

         <p>
            One thing to keep in mind is that you only have 30 days to recover a
            deleted file before it is permanently deleted. If you don't see the
            file in the Recently Deleted folder, it may have already been
            deleted permanently.
         </p>

         <p>
            Losing a file can be a stressful experience, but with the Recently
            Deleted feature in the Files app, you can recover your deleted files
            with ease. Just remember to check the Recently Deleted folder within
            30 days of deleting the file. By following these simple steps,
            you'll never have to worry about losing an important file on your
            iPhone or iPad again.

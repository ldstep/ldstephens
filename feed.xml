            <p>The other day I saved an article to <a href="https://goodlinks.app">Goodlinks</a> to read later. Today I decided to read it and discovered that the article is a 33 minute read. I didn’t want to take the time to read it right then, I thought that’s something that I would like to read on my Kindle Paperwhite while I’m in bed this evening<sup><a href="#fn1-27410" id="fnr1-27410" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. The next question is how the hell do I get this article on my Kindle? </p>

            <p>It was easy. I opened the article on my iPhone and saved it to my Kindle via the share sheet save to Kindle. I wrote this to share a helpful tip I didn’t know about myself. If you’re interested in doing the same thing, I hope you find it useful!</p>

            <ol>

            <p>I read in bed every night before going to sleep. <a href="#fnr1-27410" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>
            </li>

            </ol>

            <p>I’ve been thinking about this sudden rush to Bluesky and I have started to use it a little more but I keep coming down to the mindset you could just get your own blog instead.</p>

            <p>I also noticed the rush to Bluesky, so I reactivated my account the other day to see what was happening. Today, I deactivated my account again. I just don’t get the point of social media. To me, it’s nonsensical (my opinion). It’s probably that I’m old school and would rather read your blog in my RSS feed.</p>

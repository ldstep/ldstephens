            <description>Hey friends, as you know, I’ve been experimenting with a static site. As of today, this site is built entirely with HTML and CSS and hosted on Netlify. No complex server-side processing, databases, tracking scripts, cookies, or analytics—just a clean, straightforward site.
            
            I considered using a static site generator but decided it wasn’t necessary for something this simple. Right now, it’s still in a testing phase. I want to make sure everything’s working smoothly, including the RSS feed. If I hit any issues, I might need to move back to Bearblog.
            
            Let me know if you spot anything off.</description>

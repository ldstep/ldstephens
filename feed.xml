            <blockquote>
            <p>macOS Sequoia introduces another new feature labelled Help Apple Improve Search, which sends and stores various search queries from Safari, Spotlight, and other sources to improve search results.</p>

            <p>This feature, too, is enabled by default and is well hidden at the very bottom of System Settings &gt; Spotlight.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>It turns out that I had disabled this setting on my iPhone, and iPad but not on my Mac so I disabled it. </p>

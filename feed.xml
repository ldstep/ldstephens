            <p>Yesterday was a bit of a rollercoaster when it came to my blog setup. I started the day with a plan after reading Herman’s <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/manifesto/">Bear Manifesto</a> post: move ldstephens back to Bearblog. This change would reduce the friction associated with posting to a static site, and Bearblog would provide me with built-in analytics. Seemed like a win-win.</p>

            <p>Later in the afternoon, I tackled a necessary but tedious task in Bearblog—changing all the canonical links to alias and moved the DNS server setting to Bearblog.</p>

            <p>And then, plot twist! By the evening, I decided to move ldstephens back to Netlify. At the end of the day, I just love that I built this site myself. There’s something satisfying about knowing it's mine, running on my own setup.</p>

            <p>So, after all that back and forth, I'm right back where I started. But hey, sometimes you have to try something just to confirm that what you had was already the best fit.</p>

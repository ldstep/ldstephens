            <p>While walking this morning and listening to ATP episode 614, the subject of how to cancel a drag and drop came up again. Of course, <a href="https://hypercritical.co/about/">John Siracus</a> knew the answer. I didnâ€™t. I was glad to learn the answer because there have been times that I have started a drag and drop to move files to a different folder, and for some reason, it gets fucked up (user error missing the target folder), and I always panic and want to end the drag and drop.</p>

            <p>According to John, all you need to do is <em>use the escape key</em>. I tested it and it works.</p>

            <p>Thanks, John!</p>

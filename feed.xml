            <p>Hey friends, I know many of you prefer mono fonts for writing and coding. I recently discovered a new mono-spaced font that you might be interested in. Macosguru <a href="https://bicycleforyourmind.com/links%20of%20note%202025-01-21">posted</a> about a new text editor he found and also mentioned that the app’s default font, Zed mono, was clean and well-designed.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p><a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a> is a new text editor which is built around the collaboration between humans and AI. I am not interested in that particular activity but it is an interesting addition to the world of text editors. It is snappy, clean, and modern. I don’t have a need for it, having immersed myself in Emacs. But if you are looking for an editor, I would give this a shot.</p>

            <p>Talking about Zed. I loved the fonts that the editor uses as default. They have made them available.<a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed-fonts">The Zed Mono and Sans typefaces, custom built from Iosevka</a>. I can’t resist a free font, specially a well-designed, clean one. Get them to use in your editor of choice.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Like Macosguru, I’m not interested in Zed’s text editor, but I did download the mono fonts. I’m currently typing this in MarkEdit using the Zed mono-spaced font, and I like it. I’m going to use it for a while and see if it sticks for me. Check out the Zed editor and Zed fonts for more information.</p>

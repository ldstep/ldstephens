            <p>Hey friends, at 80, I like to think I’m pretty fit for my age. I’m 6 feet tall and weigh 165 pounds. Trix, our dog, and I walk 2 miles every single day, no exceptions. We’ve got a 10-acre property that keeps me plenty busy. In the winter, we heat the house with firewood I cut and split myself. I have a 35-ton log splitter that makes the job easier. Staying active is just who I am.</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago I took a tumble down the basement stairs. Luckily I didn’t get hurt badly. A sore hip, sore back, and a gash on the palm of my left hand from attempting to catch myself. Oh yeah, my Apple Watch didn’t detect my fall. What the fuck? </p>

            <p>This isn’t my only fall over the last few years. As you age, poor balance becomes a concern, as the risk of falls increases. So with this last fall, Lisa insisted that I start doing Yoga that focuses on improving balance and core strength. So to get her off my back I agreed to start doing Yoga three times a week. Week one I realized how shitty my balance is. Week two I’m starting to see some slight improvement. Now on top of everything else that I do, I’m doing yoga three times a week.</p>

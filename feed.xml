            <p>We recently got a Sleep Number bed. I snore, which makes it difficult for Lisa to sleep. The bed has a snore setting that automatically adjusts its position to help reduce snoring. When activated, it gently raises the head of the bed by a few degrees to open airways and improve breathing. So when I snore, Lisa can adjust my side of the bed until I stop.</p>

            <p>This morning, when I woke up, I was surprised to find myself almost upright. Lisa said she kept adjusting the bed until I quit snoring&#8211;and that was the position when I finally stopped. At this rate, I might as well start sleeping in a recliner.</p>

            <p>By the way, the Sleep Number bed has been wonderful for my lower back.</p>

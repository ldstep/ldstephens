            <p>Here we are again - another year has flown by! They seem to go by faster and faster, and 2024 was no exception. It&#8217;s hard to believe we&#8217;re already in 2025.</p>

            <p>While I&#8217;m not one to dwell too much on the past, I will say that 2024 was a good year for Lisa and me. Looking ahead, my hope for 2025 is to continue living a healthy lifestyle and making the most of each day. I&#8217;ve got a couple of significant milestones coming up this year, which I&#8217;ll likely share more about when the time comes.</p>

            <p>Happy New Year, and thank you for being a reader!</p>

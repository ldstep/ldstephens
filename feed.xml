            <p><a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a>? It stands for &quot;Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere&quot; - basically where you post stuff on your site first, then share it around on social media and whatnot, always linking back to your original post.</p>

            <p>Thing is, I've been wondering if I should be doing this. And for me, it's clearly no. Since I don't use social media, why would I want to put my blog posts there? Sure, maybe I'd pick up a few more RSS subscribers, but that's not why I'm blogging in the first place.</p>

            <p>My blog is its own thing. It’s mainly just a place to get my thoughts out there. My RSS followers are my people, and I pick up new ones now and then when other bloggers link to something I wrote. And that’s perfectly fine with me.</p>

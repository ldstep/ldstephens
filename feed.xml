            <p>Feeding time around here is no joke! We go through 100 pounds of cracked corn every week to keep the deer and wild turkeys happy as they wander our 10-acre property. Our place is actually a Certified Wildlife Habitat with the state of New Jersey, and we love all the creatures that call it home.</p>

            <p>On top of that, we go through 40 pounds of birdseed for all the birds. Of course, the raccoon has figured out a little trickâ€”every night, it climbs the tree, hangs off the bird feeder, and dumps the seed just so it can feast. Smart little guy! I havenâ€™t spotted the groundhog yet this year, but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll make an appearance soon. </p>

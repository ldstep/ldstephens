            <p>I just read Jack Bay’s post <a href="https://baty.net/2024/12/from-hugo-to-ghost-and-back-again/">From Hugo to Ghost and back again</a> about how often he switches up his blogging engine.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>I can hear you all giggling. Ha ha very funny, Jack changed his blog again. I get it. Most normal people don’t change blogging engines every month or two.[…] Also, and maybe most importantly, I prefer static websites. The arguments in favor of static websites are enough, but they aren’t why I want a static site. It <em>feels</em> better having a static website. The actual publishing part can be a pain in the ass (:::cough::, Hugo) but the results are worth it. A folder full of HTML files and some images, starting on my local drive and synced to a simple web server…mmmmm, yummy.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This reminds me a bit of myself. You may have noticed that after switching this blog to a static site, I&#8217;ve moved it back to Bearblog and then back to static a couple of times over the last few weeks. Much like Jack, it just feels better to have a static website. I take pride in something I&#8217;ve built, and my content isn&#8217;t locked inside Bear.</p>

            <p>And yes, I agree &#8211; publishing with a static site is a pain in the ass, but it&#8217;s worth the extra effort.</p>

            <p>To stop the constant switching, I decided to close my Bear account. In the end, this entire site is just a folder full of HTML files on my SSD, synced to GitHub and hosted on Netlify.</p>
